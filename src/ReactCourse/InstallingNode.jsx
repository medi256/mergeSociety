      <h1>Installing Node.js and npm</h1>

      <p>
        Before we start building React applications, there are two key tools we
        need to set up on your computer: <strong>Node.js </strong> and{" "}
        <strong>npm </strong>. These tools will help you create and manage your
        React projects. Don’t worry if these terms sound a bit confusing at
        first; I’ll break them down and explain why we need them.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
      <p>
        Node.js is like a helper that allows you to run JavaScript on your
        computer, outside of the browser. Normally, JavaScript is used to make
        websites interactive, but it runs inside a web browser like Chrome or
        Firefox. However, when you start working with tools like React, you’ll
        need JavaScript to run on your computer itself, and that’s what
        <strong> Node.js </strong> allows you to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of it this way: If you want to build a treehouse, you’ll need
        tools like a hammer and nails. In the world of JavaScript,{" "}
        <strong>Node.js </strong>
        is one of those essential tools. It allows us to build and run
        JavaScript-based projects like React.
      </p>

      <h2>What is npm?</h2>
      <p>
        Now, along with Node.js, we also need something called{" "}
        <strong> npm </strong>, which stands for{" "}
        <strong>Node Package Manager </strong>. In simple terms, npm is a tool
        that helps you install and manage software packages (pieces of code)
        that you’ll use in your React project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s go back to the treehouse example. Imagine you’re building your
        treehouse, but you don’t want to make every part from scratch. You might
        buy ready-made parts, like pre-cut wooden boards or ladders. npm is like
        a giant store that contains thousands of ready-made pieces of code
        (called <strong>packages </strong> ) that you can use in your projects,
        so you don’t have to build everything yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, <strong>Node.js </strong> and <strong> npm </strong> will make
        your life much easier as a React developer by helping you run your
        project and use all the great tools that others have already created.
      </p>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Guide: Installing Node.js and npm</h2>

      <p>
        Now that you know what Node.js and npm are, let’s go ahead and install
        them on your computer. The good news is that npm comes bundled with
        Node.js, so by installing Node.js, you’ll automatically get npm too.
        Here’s how to do it:
      </p>

      <h3>Step 1: Go to the Node.js Website</h3>
      <p>
        First, open your web browser and go to the official Node.js website:{" "}
        <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          https://nodejs.org/
        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        When you get there, you’ll see two versions of Node.js available for
        download. One is labeled as <strong> LTS (Long Term Support)</strong>,
        and the other is the <strong>Current </strong> version. For beginners,
        it’s best to go with the LTS version, as it’s more stable and reliable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Click the green button that says "LTS" to start downloading Node.js.
        </strong>
      </p>
      <AdUnit />
      <h3>Step 2: Install Node.js</h3>
      <p>
        Once the download is complete, open the file to begin the installation
        process. This will open a setup wizard that will guide you through the
        installation. Here’s what to do:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click "Next" to move through the installation screens.</li>
        <li>Agree to the license agreement when prompted.</li>
        <li>
          Keep the default installation settings (you don’t need to change
          anything here).
        </li>
        <li>Click "Install" and wait for the process to complete.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When the installation finishes, click "Finish" to close the setup.
        Congratulations, you’ve just installed Node.js and npm on your computer!
      </p>

      <h3>Step 3: Verify the Installation</h3>
      <p>
        After installing Node.js, it’s a good idea to make sure everything was
        installed correctly. To do this, you’ll need to use your computer’s
        <strong>command line </strong> (also known as Terminal on Mac or Command
        Prompt on Windows). Don’t worry if you’ve never used the command line
        before—we’ll guide you through it step by step.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Open your command line. On Windows, you can search for "Command
          Prompt" in the Start menu. On a Mac, open the "Terminal" application
          (you can find it using Spotlight Search).
        </li>
        <li>
          Once your command line is open, type the following command and press
          Enter:
          <pre>node -v</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This command asks your computer to tell you what version of Node.js is
        installed. If everything worked correctly, you’ll see a version number
        pop up, like `v16.x.x` (the numbers might be different depending on the
        version you installed).
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, we’ll check if npm was installed correctly. In the same command
        line, type the following and press Enter:
        <pre>npm -v</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like with Node.js, this will show the version of npm that’s
        installed on your computer. You should see a number like `8.x.x` (again,
        the numbers might be different based on your installation).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you see version numbers for both Node.js and npm, you’re good to go!
        Everything is installed correctly.
      </p>
      <AdUnit />
      <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
      <p>
        Now that Node.js and npm are installed, you’re ready to move forward and
        start creating React projects. In the next lesson, we’ll set up a code
        editor (I recommend Visual Studio Code) and create your first React
        project using a tool called <strong>Create React App </strong>. Stay
        tuned!
      </p>
      <div className="button-container">
        <button onClick={() => (window.location.href = "/overViewReact")}>
          back
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => (window.location.href = "/settingCodeEditor")}>
          Next
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default InstallingNode;

      <h1>Setting Up Your Code Editor (VS Code Recommended)</h1>

      <p>
        Now that you have Node.js and npm installed, the next tool you’ll need
        is a <strong>code editor </strong> . A code editor is where you’ll
        write, edit, and manage all your React code. It’s kind of like the
        notebook or workspace where you’ll be crafting your projects.
      </p>

      <h2>What is a Code Editor?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong> code editor</strong> is a special program designed for
        writing and editing code. While you can technically use any text editor
        (like Notepad or TextEdit) to write code, a code editor comes with
        features that make coding a lot easier and more efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of it like this: Imagine trying to build a house. You could use
        your bare hands to carry bricks and hammer nails, but it would be much
        easier if you had the right tools—like a hammer, a wheelbarrow, or a
        level. Similarly, a code editor is packed with tools that help you write
        clean, error-free code quickly. It makes your job much easier!
      </p>

      <h2>Why We Recommend VS Code (Visual Studio Code)</h2>
      <p>
        There are many code editors out there, but we highly recommend{" "}
        <strong>Visual Studio Code (VS Code) </strong> , especially if you’re a
        beginner. Here’s why:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Beginner-friendly:</strong> VS Code is simple to use and easy
          to set up, making it perfect for those just getting started.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Free:</strong> It’s completely free to download and use, with
          no hidden costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Helpful features:</strong> It comes with great features like
          <strong> syntax highlighting</strong> (which makes your code colorful
          and easier to read) and <strong> auto-completion</strong> (which helps
          you type faster by suggesting code as you write).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Extensions:</strong> You can add extra tools called
          "extensions" to make VS Code even more powerful. For example, there’s
          an extension for React that helps you write React code more
          efficiently.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cross-platform:</strong> Whether you’re using Windows, macOS,
          or Linux, VS Code works on all of them.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Guide: Installing and Setting Up VS Code</h2>

      <h3>Step 1: Download VS Code</h3>
      <p>
        The first step is to download VS Code to your computer. Follow these
        steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Open your web browser and go to the official VS Code website:{" "}
          <a
            href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            https://code.visualstudio.com/
          </a>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          On the website, you’ll see a big blue button that says **Download for
          Windows** (or macOS/Linux, depending on your system). Click the button
          to start downloading the installer.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 2: Install VS Code</h3>
      <p>
        Once the download is complete, open the file to start the installation
        process. A setup wizard will appear, guiding you through the
        installation. Here’s what to do:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click "Next" on the welcome screen.</li>
        <li>Agree to the license terms and click "Next".</li>
        <li>
          Choose a destination folder for the installation (you can leave the
          default location unchanged).
        </li>
        <li>
          Select any additional tasks like creating a desktop shortcut (this
          makes it easy to open VS Code later).
        </li>
        <li>Click "Install" to begin the installation.</li>
        <li>
          Once the installation is complete, click "Finish" to launch VS Code.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <AdUnit />
      <h3>Step 3: Explore the VS Code Interface</h3>
      <p>
        When you first open VS Code, you might feel a bit overwhelmed by all the
        buttons and options. But don’t worry! Let’s break down the key areas
        you’ll be using as a beginner:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Explorer:</strong> This is where you’ll see all the files and
          folders in your project. It’s like the file manager on your computer,
          but it’s built into VS Code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Editor:</strong> This is the main area where you’ll write your
          code. Each file you open will appear as a tab in this space, so you
          can easily switch between files.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Terminal:</strong> VS Code has a built-in terminal, which
          allows you to run commands directly within the editor. For example,
          you’ll use this terminal to run your React app later.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Extensions:</strong> On the left-hand side, you’ll see an icon
          that looks like four squares. This is where you can browse and install
          extensions to add more functionality to VS Code.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 4: Install Extensions (Optional)</h3>
      <p>
        VS Code is great on its own, but you can make it even better by adding
        **extensions**. Think of extensions as extra tools or features that can
        help you code more efficiently. For React, we recommend installing the
        following extensions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets</strong> : This
          extension provides shortcuts that will help you write React code
          faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Prettier - Code formatter </strong>: This is a tool that
          automatically formats your code, making sure it looks neat and
          organized.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To install an extension, click the <strong>Extensions </strong> icon
        (the four squares) on the left side of the screen. In the search bar,
        type the name of the extension you want to install, then click the
        <strong>Install </strong> button.
      </p>
      <AdUnit />
      <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
      <p>
        Now that you have VS Code set up, you’re ready to start coding! In the
        next section, we’ll show you how to create your first React project
        using <strong> Create React App</strong>. This is where the fun really
        begins, so stay tuned!

      <h1>Creating a New React Project Using Create React App</h1>

      <p>
        Now that you have <code>Node.js </code> , <code>npm </code>, and{" "}
        <strong> VS Code</strong> installed and set up, it’s time to create your
        very first React project! This will be your workspace where you’ll
        write, test, and run your React code. We’ll be using a tool called
        **Create React App** to make this process easy and fast.
      </p>

      <h2>What is Create React App?</h2>
      <p>
        <code> Create React App </code> is a tool developed by the React team to
        help you quickly set up a React project with all the necessary files and
        configurations. Think of it as a "starter kit" for React. You won’t have
        to manually set up a bunch of files or worry about configuration—Create
        React App does all that for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s like getting a ready-to-cook meal kit. Instead of buying each
        ingredient separately and figuring out how to prepare them, you get
        everything neatly packed and ready to use.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Use Create React App?</h2>
      <p>
        There are many benefits to using Create React App, especially for
        beginners:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> Quick setup</strong> : It creates all the files you need to
          start coding right away.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No configuration needed </strong> : Everything is
          pre-configured so you don’t have to worry about setting up things like
          Webpack, Babel, or other tools.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Development server </strong> : It comes with a built-in
          server, so you can easily run and test your project as you build it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ready for production </strong> : When you’re ready to publish
          your project, Create React App will help you create a version of your
          project that’s optimized for performance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Guide: Creating a React Project</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s walk through the steps to create your first React project using
        <strong> Create React App</strong> .
      </p>

      <h3>Step 1: Open Your Terminal</h3>
      <p>
        The first thing you need to do is open a terminal (also called a command
        line). In VS Code, there’s a built-in terminal that you can use, so
        let’s do that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open VS Code.</li>
        <li>
          Go to the top menu and click on <code>{`Terminal > `}</code>{" "}
          <code>New Terminal</code>. This will open the terminal at the bottom
          of your screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you’re not using VS Code, you can open the terminal on your
          computer by searching for "Command Prompt" (on Windows) or "Terminal"
          (on macOS/Linux).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 2: Navigate to Your Desired Folder</h3>
      <p>
        Next, you need to decide where on your computer you want to create your
        React project. This could be inside a folder where you keep all your
        coding projects, for example. Here’s how you can navigate to the folder
        you want to work in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the terminal, type `cd path/to/your/folder`. Replace
          `path/to/your/folder` with the actual path of the folder where you
          want to create the React project.
        </li>
        <li>
          For example, if you have a folder called "ReactProjects" on your
          Desktop, you would type `cd Desktop/ReactProjects`.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you don’t have a specific folder in mind, you can skip this step,
          and it will create the project in the folder you’re currently in.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <AdUnit />
      <h3>Step 3: Run the Create React App Command</h3>
      <p>
        Now comes the exciting part: creating your project! To do this, we’ll
        use <strong>npm </strong> (which you installed with Node.js). In the
        terminal, run the following command:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>npx create-react-app my-first-react-app</code>
      </pre>
      <p>Here’s what this command does:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>npx </code>: This is a tool that comes with npm. It allows you
          to run commands without needing to install the tool globally on your
          computer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code> create-react-app </code> : This is the name of the tool we’re
          using to create the React project.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code> my-first-react-app</code> : This is the name of your project.
          You can change this to anything you want, but for now, we’ll use this
          name to keep things simple.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once you hit <strong>Enter </strong> , Create React App will start
        building your project. It might take a minute or two to install
        everything. During this time, it’s setting up all the necessary files
        and dependencies for you. You’ll see a lot of messages in the terminal,
        but don’t worry—this is completely normal!
      </p>

      <h3>Step 4: Open Your New React Project</h3>
      <p>
        After the installation is complete, you’ll have a new folder called
        `my-first-react-app` (or whatever you named your project) in the folder
        where you ran the command. This folder contains all the files for your
        React project.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To navigate into your new project folder, type the following command
          in the terminal and hit <strong>Enter </strong> :{" "}
        </li>
        <pre>
          <code>cd my-first-react-app</code>
        </pre>
        <li>
          This command moves you into your project folder, where you’ll be able
          to start working with your React code.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 5: Start the Development Server</h3>
      <p>
        Before you start coding, let’s see if everything is working correctly by
        running your React project. React comes with a built-in{" "}
        <strong>development server </strong> that allows you to see your project
        in action while you’re building it. To start the server, type the
        following command:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>npm start</code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        This will start the development server, and your React app will
        automatically open in your web browser. By default, it opens on
        <strong> http://localhost:3000</strong> . If everything is set up
        correctly, you should see the default React welcome page that looks like
        this:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png"
          alt="React logo"
          style={{ width: "300px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto" }}
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        Congratulations! You’ve successfully created your first React project
        and it’s running locally on your computer!
      </p>
      <AdUnit />
      <h2>What’s Inside Your New React Project?</h2>
      <p>
        Now that your React app is up and running, let’s take a quick look at
        the project structure. Inside the `my-first-react-app` folder, you’ll
        see several files and folders that were automatically created for you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code> node_modules/ </code> : This folder contains all the
          dependencies (external libraries) that your project needs to run. You
          don’t need to worry about these files.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>public/ </code> : This folder contains files that are public,
          meaning they can be accessed by the user’s browser. It includes files
          like `index.html`, where your React app is displayed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>src/ </code> : This is the most important folder—it contains
          your React code! You’ll be spending most of your time working inside
          this folder. Inside, you’ll see:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code> App.js </code> : This is the main component of your React
              app, where most of your code will go.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>index.js </code> : This is the entry point for your app.
              It’s where React renders the `App` component and mounts it to the
              `index.html` file.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <code> package.json </code> : This file lists the dependencies your
          project needs, along with other metadata like the project name and
          version.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
      <p>
        Now that you’ve set up your first React project, you’re ready to start
        building amazing things with React! In the next section, we’ll dive into
        <strong> JSX </strong> (JavaScript XML) and see how React allows you to
        build user interfaces using components.

      <h1>Understanding the Project Structure</h1>

      <p>
        When you first create a new React project, you might feel a little
        overwhelmed by all the files and folders that appear. But don’t worry!
        We’re going to walk through each part of the project step by step, so
        you’ll understand what everything does and why it’s there.
      </p>

      <h2>Folder and File Structure of a React Project</h2>
      <p>
        Here’s what the typical project structure looks like right after you run
        the <strong>Create React App </strong> command:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>{`
my-first-react-app/
├── node_modules/
├── public/
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
├── src/
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── App.test.js
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.js
│   └── logo.svg
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── README.md
`}</code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        Let’s go through each part of this structure to understand what it all
        means.
      </p>

      <h2>
        The <code>node_modules/</code> Folder
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is one of the most important folders in your project, but it’s also
        the one you’ll probably never touch directly. The{" "}
        <strong> node_modules/</strong>
        folder contains all the dependencies (or libraries) that your project
        needs to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of it like a toolbox. Whenever you use React or another library,
        the actual code for that tool lives inside{" "}
        <strong> node_modules/</strong>. You don’t need to worry about modifying
        any files here—it’s all managed by
        <strong> npm </strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might seem big and full of files, but that’s because there are a lot
        of tools React relies on to work smoothly. Whenever you install a new
        package (like React Router, for example), it gets added to this folder.
      </p>

      <h2>
        The <code>public/</code> Folder
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <code>public/ </code> folder contains files that are publicly
        accessible by the browser. Anything in this folder can be accessed
        directly from the browser, which makes it important for storing static
        files that don’t change, like images, icons, and the main{" "}
        <strong> index.html </strong>
        file.
      </p>
      <AdUnit />
      <h3>
        Key Files Inside <code>public/</code>:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code> favicon.ico </code> : This is the small icon that appears next
          to your website’s name in the browser tab. You can replace it with
          your own logo or icon if you like.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>index.html </code> : This is the main HTML file for your React
          app. It’s the single HTML file where your entire React app is
          injected. You don’t need to edit this file often, but it’s important
          to know that this is where React attaches your app to the DOM.
          <br />
          Inside this file, there’s a {`<div>`} with an `id="root"`. This is
          where React will "mount" your app, meaning it will insert everything
          you build into this single {`<div>`}.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code> manifest.json</code> : This file contains metadata about your
          app, like its name, icons, and theme color. It’s used when your app is
          installed on mobile devices or used as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        The <code>src/</code> Folder
      </h2>
      <p>
        This is where the magic happens! The **src/** folder contains all the
        source code for your React app. Every time you write new code, you’ll be
        working inside this folder. Let’s take a closer look at the important
        files here:
      </p>

      <h3>
        Key Files Inside <code>src/</code>:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code> App.js</code> : This is the main component of your React app.
          When you start coding, you’ll write most of your logic inside
          <code> App.js </code>. Think of it as the brain of your application,
          where you control what the app does and how it looks.
          <br />
          In React, everything is built using components, and{" "}
          <code>App.js </code> is the main component that holds the other
          components. When you start building your project, you’ll add more
          components, but this file is where you usually start.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code> App.css</code> : This file contains the styles (CSS) for the
          <code> App.js</code> component. If you want to change how your app
          looks (colors, fonts, layout), you can edit this file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code> App.test.js </code>: This file is used for testing your React
          components. Don’t worry about this too much for now, especially if
          you’re a beginner, but know that this file is where you can write
          tests to make sure your app is working correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>index.js </code>: This is a very important file. It’s the entry
          point of your app. <code>index.js </code> is responsible for rendering
          the <code>App.js </code> component inside the `index.html` file we
          talked about earlier.
          <br />
          The main job of this file is to "mount" (or attach) the **App**
          component to the DOM. It looks for the {`<div>`} with `id="root"` in
          <code>index.html </code> and inserts your React app there.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code> index.css</code>: This file contains global styles for your
          entire app. Any styles written here will apply to all components in
          your app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>logo.svg </code>: This is the React logo that you see when you
          first run your app. You can replace this with your own logo or image
          later.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Other Important Files</h2>

      <h3>
        The <code>package.json</code> File
      </h3>
      <p>
        The <strong>package.json </strong> file is like the "blueprint" for your
        project. It contains important information like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <strong>name </strong> and <strong>version </strong> of your
          project.
        </li>
        <li>
          A list of <strong> dependencies</strong> (libraries) your project
          needs to run. For example, you’ll see React listed here because your
          app needs it to work. Any time you install a new library (using npm),
          it gets added to this list.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>Scripts </code> : These are commands that help you run or build
          your app. For example, the script `"start"` runs your app in
          development mode. You’ll usually run this using `npm start`.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <AdUnit />
      <h3>
        The <code>README.md</code> File
      </h3>
      <p>
        The <code>README.md </code> file contains information about your
        project. This is where you can write instructions or notes for anyone
        looking at your project. If you share your project with others (like on
        GitHub), this file will be the first thing people see when they visit
        your project page.
      </p>

      <h3>
        The <code>.gitignore</code> File
      </h3>
      <p>
        The <code>.gitignore </code> file tells Git which files or folders to
        ignore when you push your project to a repository (like GitHub). This is
        useful for avoiding unnecessary files (like{" "}
        <strong>node_modules/ </strong> ) from being uploaded to your
        repository.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding How Everything Works Together</h2>
      <p>
        Now that you understand what each file and folder does, let’s quickly
        summarize how they all work together:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code> index.html</code>: The single HTML file where your React app is
          rendered.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>index.js</code>: The JavaScript file that "mounts" your React
          app to the DOM (inside the `root` div in <strong>index.html </strong>{" "}
          ).
        </li>
        <li>
          <code> App.js</code>: The main component of your React app, where most
          of your code will go.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>node_modules/ </code>: Contains all the libraries and tools your
          project depends on.
        </li>
        <li>
          <code>public/</code>: Contains files that are publicly accessible,
          like
          <code>index.html</code> and icons.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        With this structure in mind, you now have a clear idea of where to write
        your code, where your styles go, and how everything connects.
      </p>

        Now that you understand the project structure, you’re ready to start
