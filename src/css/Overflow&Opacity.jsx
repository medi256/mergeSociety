      <h2>Understanding Overflow</h2>
      <p>
        {`The overflow property in CSS specifies what should happen if content 
        overflows an element's box. By default, content that doesn't fit will 
        overflow the box, causing layout issues. Here are the key values you can 
        use with the overflow property:`}

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>visible:</strong>{" "}
          {`This is the default value. The overflow

          to see the rest of the content, but only if necessary.`}
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Example: Overflow Visible</h3>
      <p>
        {`Let's start with the default overflow value, visible. Here, the content 
        will overflow outside the container. This can be useful if you want to 
        display content that exceeds the container size, but it can also cause 
        layout issues:`}

        the box. This can sometimes lead to unexpected layout issues if not 
        handled properly.`}

      <h3>Example: Overflow Hidden</h3>
      <p>
        {`Next, let's see how overflow hidden works. The overflowing content will 
        be clipped and hidden. This is useful when you want to hide any content

        help maintain a clean and tidy layout without any overflowing content 
        disrupting the design.`}

      <h3>Example: Overflow Scroll</h3>
      <p>
        {`Now, let's see how overflow scroll works. The overflowing content will 
        be clipped, but a scrollbar will be added. This allows users to scroll

        a lot of content that needs to be accessed, but you want to keep the 
        container size fixed.`}

      <h3>Example: Overflow Auto</h3>
      <p>
        {`Finally, let's see how overflow auto works. A scrollbar will be added 
        only if necessary. This means that if the content fits within the 
        container, no scrollbar will be shown. If the content overflows, a 
        scrollbar will appear:`}
