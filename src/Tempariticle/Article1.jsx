              <h3>Trucking Accidents:</h3>

              <p>
                Trucking accidents differ significantly from typical motor
                vehicle collisions due to the size and weight of commercial
                trucks. These accidents often result in catastrophic injuries or
                even fatalities due to the immense force involved. Factors such
                as driver fatigue, improper maintenance, overloaded trucks, and
                negligent driving can contribute to these accidents. Moreover,
                navigating the legal aftermath of a trucking accident can be
                incredibly complex, involving multiple parties such as trucking
                companies, insurers, and regulatory agencies.
