      <h1>Images in HTML</h1>
      <p>
        {`Hello there! In this lesson, we'll be exploring images - a crucial
        component of modern web pages. Images can enhance the visual appeal of
        your website, convey information, and engage your users. Let's dive into
        the world of images in HTML and learn how to embed and customize images
        effectively.`}
      </p>

      <h2>Embedding Images in HTML</h2>
      <p>
        In HTML, images are embedded using the <code>{`<img>`}</code> tag. The{" "}
        <code>{`<img>`}</code>{" "}
        {`tag
        is a self-closing tag, which means it doesn't have a closing tag. Here's
        the basic structure of embedding an image in HTML:`}
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the code above, the <code>{`<img>`}</code>{" "}
        {`tag is used to embed an image. The
        "src" attribute specifies the source or URL of the image file. The "alt"
        attribute provides alternative text for screen readers and when the
        image cannot be displayed.`}
      </p>

      <h2>Customizing Image Appearance</h2>
      <p>
        {`You can customize the appearance of images in HTML using attributes like
        width and height. These attributes allow you to control the dimensions of
        the displayed image. Here's an example:`}
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image" width="300" height="200">
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        {`In the code above, we added the "width" and "height" attributes to the`}
        <code>{`<img> `}</code> tag.{" "}
        {`The values "300" and "200" specify the width and height
        of the image in pixels, respectively. You can adjust these values to
        control the size of the displayed image.`}
      </p>

      <h2>Different Ways to Provide Image Source</h2>
      <p>There are several ways to provide the source or URL of an image:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Relative URL:</strong>{" "}
          {`You can use a relative URL if the image
          file is located in the same folder as your HTML file. For example, if
          your HTML file is "index.html" and the image file is "image.jpg," you
          can simply use`}
          <br />
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
                {`
            
<img src="image.jpg">.
            `}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Absolute URL:</strong> If the image is hosted on a web server,
          you can use the absolute URL to specify its location. For example,
          <br />
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
                {`
            
<img src="https://www.example.com/image.jpg">.
            `}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data URLs:</strong>{" "}
          {`You can encode the image data directly
          into the "src" attribute using a data URL. This is useful for small
          images or icons. For example,`}
          <br />
          <pre>
            <code>

      <h2>Best Practices for Using Images</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Use descriptive alt text:</strong>{" "}
          {`The "alt" attribute is
          crucial for accessibility. It provides alternative text for screen
          readers and users who cannot see the image. Make sure the alt text
          accurately describes the image.`}
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Optimize image size:</strong>{" "}
          {`Large image files can slow down
          your website's loading time. Use image editing tools to compress and
          optimize your images without sacrificing quality.`}
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use responsive images:</strong>{" "}
          {`Make sure your images are
          responsive, meaning they adjust to different screen sizes and
          devices. You can use CSS or modern HTML attributes like "srcset" and
          "sizes" to achieve responsiveness.`}
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provide fallback options:</strong> If an image cannot be
          displayed, provide fallback options like alternative text or a
          placeholder image. This ensures that users still get some information
          even if the image fails to load.

        into the world of audio in HTML and learn how to embed and customize audio
        effectively.`}
      </p>

      <h2>Embedding Audio in HTML</h2>
      <p>
        In HTML, audio is embedded using the <code>{`<audio>`}</code> tag. The{" "}
        <code>{`<audio>`}</code> tag is **not** a self-closing tag. This means
        it requires a closing tag (<code>{`</audio>`}</code>) to properly define
        the audio element and its content.{" "}
        {`Here's the basic structure of
        embedding audio in HTML:`}
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
<audio src="audio.mp3" controls>
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
        
        `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the code above, the <code>{`<audio>`}</code>{" "}
        {`tag is used to embed an audio file.
        The "src" attribute specifies the source or URL of the audio file. The
        "controls" attribute adds playback controls to the audio player, allowing
        users to play, pause, and control the volume.`}
      </p>

      <h2>Supporting Multiple Audio Formats</h2>
      <p>
        Different browsers support different audio formats, so {`it's`} a good
        practice to provide multiple audio formats within the{" "}
        <code>{`<audio>`}</code> tag. You can do this using the{" "}
        <code>{`<source>`}</code> tag. {`Here's an example:`}
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.

          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the code above, we included two <code>{`<source>`}</code> tags within
        the
        <code>{`<audio>`}</code> tag. Each <code>{`<source>`}</code>{" "}
        {`tag specifies a different audio
        format using the "src" attribute, and the "type" attribute indicates the
        MIME type of the audio file.`}
      </p>

      <h2>Autoplay and Looping Audio</h2>
      <p>
        You can configure the <code>{`<audio>`}</code>{" "}
        {`tag to automatically play the audio
        when the web page loads and to loop the audio continuously. Here's how
        you can do that:`}
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`

          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        {`In the code above, we added the "autoplay" attribute to make the audio
        start playing automatically when the web page loads. We also added the
        "loop" attribute to make the audio repeat continuously until the user
        stops it.`}
      </p>
      <p>
        {`Don't be surprised by attributes that don't have values. Some attributes

      <h2>Customizing Audio Player Appearance</h2>
      <p>
        {`By default, the audio player in HTML is a simple rectangular box with
        playback controls. However, you can customize the appearance of the audio
        player using CSS styles. While we won't dive into CSS in this lesson,
        it's important to know that you can style the audio player to match your
        website's design or create custom audio players.`}

      <InArticleAdUnit />
      <h2>Best Practices for Using Audio</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Provide alternative content:</strong> Not all users will have
          audio enabled or may prefer to consume content without sound. Provide
          alternative content using the <code>{`<p> `}</code> tag within the{" "}
          <code>{`<audio>`}</code>
          tag. For example,
          <br />
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>

          .
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use autoplay sparingly:</strong> Autoplaying audio can be
          disruptive to users, especially if they are browsing in a quiet
          environment. Use autoplay only when it makes sense in the context of
          your web page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provide clear audio controls:</strong> Ensure that users have
          easy access to playback controls, such as play, pause, and volume
          adjustment. This is especially important for accessibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Optimize audio file size:</strong>{" "}
          {`Large audio files can slow
