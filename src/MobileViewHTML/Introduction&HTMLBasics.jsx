      <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
      <p>
        {`Welcome to the exciting world of HTML! In this course, you will learn
        about the fundamentals of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the backbone
        of every website you visit on the internet. HTML is a simple yet
        powerful language that allows us to create structured and interactive
        web pages. Let's dive in and explore its history, purpose, and how it
        works alongside other technologies like CSS and JavaScript to bring
        websites to life!`}
      </p>

      <h2>A Brief History of HTML</h2>
      <p>
        HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1980s while he was
        working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The
        goal was to create a system for sharing and distributing information
        among researchers easily. HTML became the standard markup language for
        creating web pages and has evolved over the years with various versions,
        such as HTML+, HTML 2.0, and the current HTML5.
      </p>

      <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web
        applications. It uses a set of tags and attributes to define the
        structure and content of a web page. HTML tells the web browser what to
        display and how to interpret the content, such as headings, paragraphs,
        images, videos, and links.
      </p>

      <h2>How HTML Works with CSS and JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is often used alongside two other essential web technologies: CSS
        (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript. CSS is responsible for the
        styling and layout of the HTML content, making it visually appealing.
        JavaScript, on the other hand, adds interactivity to the web page,
        enabling dynamic behavior and responsive user interfaces. Together,
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript form the foundation of modern web development.
      </p>

      <h2>The Power of HTML: What Can It Do?</h2>
      <p>
        {`HTML is everywhere on the web! It helps us display text, images, videos,
        forms, tables, and much more. With HTML, you can create informative web
        pages, build interactive forms for user input, embed multimedia content,
        and structure your website's content logically. Companies and
        organizations of all sizes rely on HTML to build their websites, from
        small startups to large enterprises like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.`}

        program designed for writing and editing code. There are many code
        editors available, but for this course, we recommend using Visual Studio

      <h2>The Building Blocks: HTML Elements</h2>
      <p>
        {`HTML is made up of a series of elements, and these elements are the
        building blocks of any web page. Each element is defined by a specific
        tag, and these tags tell the web browser what to display and how to
        interpret the content. Think of elements as the Lego bricks that come
        together to build a website. Here's a simple example:`}
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>

        structure of the web page.`}

      <h3>Container Elements and Empty Elements</h3>
      <p>
        {`There are two main types of HTML elements: container elements and empty
        elements. Container elements have both an opening tag and a closing tag,
        and they can contain other elements or text within them. For example,
        the <body> element is a container element because it can hold
        headings, paragraphs, images, and other content.`}

        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        {`On the other hand, empty elements do not have a closing tag and are
        typically used for standalone elements that don't contain other
        elements or text. For example, the <img> tag is an empty element
        used to embed an image in the web page.`}

          <strong>{`<div>`}:</strong>{" "}

        <li>
          <strong>{`<ul> and <ol>`}:</strong> These tags are used to create
          unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered) lists, respectively. List
          items are nested within these container elements.
        </li>
      </ul>

          {`As mentioned earlier, this tag is used to
          embed images in the web page. The "src" attribute specifies the
          image source, and the "alt" attribute provides alternative text for
          screen readers and when the image cannot be displayed.`}
        </li>

          <strong>{`<br>`}:</strong>{" "}
          {`This tag creates a line break, forcing the

          <strong>{`<input>`}:</strong>{" "}

      <InArticleAdUnit />
      <h2>Why Do Elements Have Opening and Closing Tags?</h2>
      <p>
        {`You might be wondering why some elements have both opening and closing
        tags while others don't. The reason lies in the nature of the content
        they contain. Container elements, like <p> or <div>,
        typically contain text or other elements, so they need a closing tag to
        indicate where the content ends. On the other hand, empty elements, like
        <img> or <br>, perform a specific function and don't
        require any content within them, so they don't need a closing tag.`}
      </p>

      <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
      <p>
        {`Now that we've explored container and empty elements, let's put it all
        together and create a simple HTML structure. Here's an example of a
        basic HTML document:`}

      <pre>
        <code>

        a paragraph, an image, and an unordered list. Notice how the container
        elements wrap the content within them, while the empty elements, like
