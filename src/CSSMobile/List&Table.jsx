        how to use CSS to transform your lists into beautiful and user-friendly
        elements. Let's embark on this list styling adventure!`}
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding List Styling</h2>
      <p>
        List styling involves applying CSS properties to lists, list items, and
        their markers to enhance their appearance and improve the user
        experience. Lists can be styled in numerous ways, including changing the
        marker style, modifying the spacing between list items, adding
        decorative effects, and even creating entirely custom markers. The{" "}
        <code>list-style-type</code> property is one of the key properties used
        for list styling. {`Let's explore it in depth:`}
      </p>

      <h3>list-style-type Property</h3>
      <p>
        The <code>list-style-type</code> property allows you to specify the type
        of marker used for list items. It can be applied to both unordered lists
        (<code>ul</code>) and ordered lists (<code>ol</code>). Here are some
        commonly used values for
        <code>list-style-type</code>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>disc:</strong> This value displays a solid circle as the
          marker. It is commonly used for unordered lists.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>circle:</strong> This value displays an empty circle as the
          marker. It is often used for nested lists or to create a more open and
          airy appearance.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>square:</strong> This value displays a filled square as the
          marker. It creates a bold and modern look for your lists.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>decimal:</strong> This value displays numbers as markers,
          starting from 1, 2, 3, and so on. It is commonly used for ordered
          lists.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>lower-alpha:</strong> This value displays lowercase letters as
          markers, starting from a, b, c, and so on. It creates an alphabetical
          list.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>upper-roman:</strong> This value displays upper-case Roman
          numerals as markers, starting from I, II, III, and so on. It adds an
          elegant touch to your lists.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>none:</strong> This value removes any markers from the list
          items, resulting in a clean and minimalist look. No bullets, numbers,
          or other markers will be displayed, allowing for a seamless
          integration into your content.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <code>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="css" style={docco}>
              {`
ul {
  list-style-type: circle; /* Changes the marker style to circles */
}

ol {
  list-style-type: lower-alpha; /* Changes the marker style to lowercase letters */
}
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
      </code>

      <p>
        In the code above, we used <code>list-style-type</code> to change the
        marker style for unordered lists to circles and for ordered lists to
        lowercase letters. You can experiment with different values to create
        lists that align with your design aesthetic and content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Experiment with the various values to see how they are displayed in your
        browser.
      </p>

      <h2>Using List Styling</h2>
      <p>
        List styling can be used to create visually appealing and functional
        lists. In addition to <code>list-style-type</code>, there are other
        properties that can be used to style lists, such as <code>padding</code>
        , <code>margin</code>, and
        <code>list-style-image</code>.{" "}
        {`Let's explore some of these properties:`}
      </p>
      <InArticleAdUnit />
      <h3>Padding and Margin</h3>
      <p>
        Padding and margin can be used to adjust the spacing around list items.
        Padding controls the space inside the list item, while margin controls
        the space outside the list item. These properties can be used to create
        indentation, add breathing room between list items, and improve the
        overall layout of your lists.
      </p>

      <code>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="css" style={docco}>
              {`
li {
  padding-left: 20px; /* Adds left padding for indentation */
  margin-bottom: 10px; /* Adds bottom margin for spacing between list items */
}
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
      </code>

      <p>
        In the code above, we added left padding to create indentation for the
        list items and bottom margin to create spacing between each item. You
        can adjust these values to achieve the desired spacing and layout for
        your lists.
      </p>

      <h3>list-style-image Property</h3>
      <p>
        The <code>list-style-image</code> property allows you to use an image as
        the marker for list items. This property can be used to create unique
        and custom list styles. {`Here's an example:`}
      </p>

      <code>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="css" style={docco}>
              {`
ul {
  list-style-image: url('custom-marker.png'); /* Uses an image as the marker */
}
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
      </code>
      <p>
        In the code above, we used the <code>list-style-image</code>{" "}
        {` property to
        specify a custom image as the marker for the unordered list. You can
        replace 'custom-marker.png' with the path to your own image file.`}
      </p>
      <h3>Note</h3>
      <p>
        The same way we uploaded images to our background-image is the way we do
        it for the list-style-type. You just need a URL.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also use other CSS properties on lists just like any other
        element. You can apply color, background, font, and many others.
      </p>

      <h2>Benefits of List Styling</h2>
      <p>Using list styling offers several advantages for your designs:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Visual Appeal:</strong> List styling allows you to enhance the
          appearance of your lists, making them more visually appealing and
          engaging. You can experiment with different marker styles, colors, and
          spacing options to create lists that complement your overall design
          aesthetic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Readability:</strong> Proper list styling improves readability
          by providing clear markers, adequate spacing, and a well-organized
          layout. This makes it easier for users to scan and understand the
          information presented in the list.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Experience:</strong> List styling can greatly improve the
          user experience. Well-styled lists guide users through content,
          highlight important information, and make navigation more intuitive.
          By styling lists effectively, you can enhance the usability and
          accessibility of your designs.

        the key properties used for table styling:`}
      </p>

      <h3>Border Properties</h3>
      <p>
        Borders are a fundamental aspect of table styling. The{" "}
        <code>border</code> property allows you to add borders around tables,
        table cells, or specific sides of a table cell. Here are some commonly
        used border properties:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>border:</strong> This property sets the border style, width,
          and color for all sides of a table or table cell. You can specify
          values for border-style, border-width, and border-color individually
          or use a shorthand value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>border-collapse:</strong> This property specifies whether
          table borders should be collapsed into a single border or separated. A
          value of
          <code>collapse</code> collapses the borders, while{" "}
          <code>separate</code>
          keeps them separate.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>border-spacing:</strong> This property sets the distance
          between adjacent table {` cells' `} borders. It is used when{" "}
          <code>border-collapse</code> is set to
          <code>separate</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <code>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="css" style={docco}>
              {`
table {
  border: 1px solid black; /* Adds a solid black border around the table */
  border-collapse: collapse; /* Collapses the borders */
}

td {
  border: 1px solid #ddd; /* Adds borders to table cells */
}
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
      </code>

      <p>
        In the code above, we added borders to the table and table cells. We
        also collapsed the borders to create a unified border around the table.
        You can experiment with different border styles, widths, and colors to
        create visually appealing tables.
      </p>

      <h3>tr:nth-child(even) Selector</h3>
      <p>
        {`The \`tr:nth-child(even)\` selector is used to target and style every
        other row in a table. This selector allows you to apply styles to
        alternating rows, creating a striped or zebra-striped effect. Here's an
        example:`}
      </p>

      <code>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="css" style={docco}>
              {`
tr:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: #eee; /* Adds a background color to every other row */
}
      `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
      </code>

      <p>
        In the code above, we used the `tr:nth-child(even)` selector to add a
        background color to every other row in the table. This creates a
        visually appealing alternating row pattern, improving readability and
        making the table more engaging.
      </p>

      <p>
        The `tr:nth-child` selector is powerful because it goes beyond just even
        rows. You can use different values to target specific rows or patterns
        of rows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            **Numbers:** Select a specific row by its number, like
            `tr:nth-child(3)` for the third row.
          </li>
          <li>
            **`odd`:** Target all odd-numbered rows, similar to how `even`
            works.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

          </code>
        </pre>
      </code>

      <p>
        In the code above, we added a background color and changed the text
        color in the table headers. We also applied alternating row colors to
        improve readability and make the table more visually appealing.
      </p>
      <InArticleAdUnit />
      <h3>Cell Spacing and Alignment</h3>
      <p>
        Cell spacing and alignment can be adjusted to improve the layout and
        readability of tables. The <code>padding</code> property adds space
        inside table cells, while the
        <code>text-align</code> property aligns text within a cell.{" "}
        {`Here's an
        example:`}
      </p>

      <code>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="css" style={docco}>
              {`
td {
  padding: 10px; /* Adds padding to table cells */
  text-align: center; /* Centers the text within the cell */
}
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
      </code>

      <p>
        In the code above, we added padding to create space around the content
