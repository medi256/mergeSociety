      <h1>Inline Elements in HTML</h1>
      <p>
        {`Hello there! In this lesson, we'll be exploring inline elements - an
        important concept in HTML. Inline elements are those that are displayed
        inline with the surrounding text, without creating line breaks or
        affecting the layout structure. Let's dive into the world of inline
        elements in HTML and learn how to use them effectively.`}
      </p>

      <h2>What Are Inline Elements in HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        Inline elements are HTML elements that are displayed inline with the
        text flow. They do not create line breaks or occupy the entire width of
        the container. Inline elements are typically used for small pieces of
        text or elements that should be displayed within a line of text, such as
        words, phrases, or short snippets of content. Here are some commonly
        used inline elements:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>
            {" "}
            <code>{`<span> `}</code> :
          </strong>{" "}
          The <code>{`<span> `}</code> element is used to group and style small
          portions of text or other inline elements.{" "}
          {` It's
          commonly used for applying styles or functionality to specific parts of
          text.`}
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            {" "}
            <code>{`<a>`}</code> :
          </strong>{" "}
          The <code>{`<a>`}</code> element, also known as an anchor tag, is used
          to create hyperlinks. It allows users to click and navigate to another
          web page or a specific location within the same page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            {" "}
            <code>{`<strong>`}</code> :
          </strong>{" "}
          The <code>{`<strong>`}</code> element is used to indicate strong
          emphasis or importance. It typically renders the enclosed text in
          bold.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            {" "}
            <code>{`<em>`}</code> :
          </strong>{" "}
          The <code>{`<em>`}</code> element is used to indicate emphasis or
          stress. It typically renders the enclosed text in italics.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            {" "}
            <code>{`<img> `}</code> :
          </strong>{" "}
          The <code>{`<img> `}</code> element is used to embed images within the
          text flow. It allows you to include images inline with the surrounding
          text.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Using Inline Elements Effectively</h2>
      <p>
        Inline elements are particularly useful when you want to style or add
        functionality to specific parts of your text without affecting the
        overall layout. Here are some tips for using inline elements
        effectively:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Use inline elements for small portions of text:</strong>{" "}
          Inline elements are best suited for styling or adding functionality to
          words, phrases, or short snippets of text.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nest inline elements within block-level elements:</strong>
          Inline elements can be nested within block-level elements, such as
          paragraphs or divs, to create more complex structures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use inline elements for interactive functionality:</strong>
          Inline elements like <code>{`<a>`}</code> or <code>{`<button>`}</code>{" "}
          can be used to create clickable elements that trigger actions or
          navigate to different locations.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Best Practices for Using Inline Elements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Use inline elements sparingly:</strong> Inline elements should
          be used only when necessary. Avoid using them for large portions of
          text or for structural purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keep inline elements semantic:</strong> Use inline elements to
          enhance the meaning or functionality of the surrounding text, not just
          for styling purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid using inline elements for block-level content:</strong>
          Inline elements should not be used for content that requires a line
          break or occupies the entire width of the container. Use block-level
          elements like <code>{`<div> `}</code> or <code>{`<p>`}</code> for
          those cases.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practice Time!</h2>
      <p>
        {`Now, let's put your knowledge into practice! Open your code editor and
        create a new HTML file. Experiment with using inline elements, nesting
        them within block-level elements, and applying styles or functionality.
        Here's a simple exercise to get you started:`}
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          {`Create a new HTML file and save it as "inline-elements.html" in your
          workspace folder.`}
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a paragraph with some text and apply styles to specific words
          using inline elements. For example,
          <br />
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
                {`
<p>This is a <strong>strong</strong> and <em>emphasized</em> sentence with a <a href="https://www.example.com">link</a>.</p>

          `}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Try nesting inline elements within block-level elements, such as
          paragraphs or divs. For instance, you can have a paragraph with inline
          elements for emphasis or links.
        </li>

      <h2>What Are Block-Level Elements in HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        Block-level elements are HTML elements that are displayed on their own
        line and occupy the full width of the container. They create line breaks
        before and after them, separating the content into distinct blocks.
        Block-level elements are typically used for larger sections of content
        or structural purposes. Here are some commonly used block-level

          The <code>{`<p>`}</code> element represents a paragraph. It is used to
          create distinct blocks of text, such as paragraphs, quotations, or
          standalone sentences.

      <h2>Using Block-Level Elements Effectively</h2>
      <p>
        Block-level elements are essential for creating the overall structure
        and layout of your web page. Here are some tips for using block-level
        elements effectively:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Use block-level elements for structural purposes:</strong>
          Block-level elements are ideal for creating sections, columns, or
          distinct blocks of content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nest block-level elements within each other:</strong>
          Block-level elements can be nested within each other to create
          hierarchical relationships and define the flow of your content.
        </li>
        <li>

          </strong>
          Block-level elements are suitable for content that requires its own
          line or occupies a significant portion of the page.

          <strong>Use semantic block-level elements:</strong> Choose the right
          block-level element based on the purpose and meaning of the content.
          For example, use <code>{`<p>`}</code> for paragraphs,{" "}
