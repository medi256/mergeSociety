      <h1> Javascript operators</h1>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Just like a toolbox has different tools for different jobs, JavaScript
        has operators that help us perform various actions on our data. These
        operators act like tiny workers that modify, combine, or compare the
        information stored in our variables.
      </p>
      <h3>The Essential Operators:</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript offers a variety of operators for different tasks. {`Let's `}
        explore some of the most common ones:
      </p>
      <h2>1. Arithmetic Operators</h2>
      <p>
        {" "}
        These operators, like +, -, *, /, and %, help us perform calculations on
        numbers. Imagine them as tiny calculators that can add, subtract,
        multiply, divide, and even find the remainder after division.
      </p>
      <h2> Explanation of JavaScript Arithmetic Operators:</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript offers a rich set of arithmetic operators that enable you to
        perform various mathematical calculations on numerical values. These
        operators are essential for writing logic that involves calculations,
        data manipulation, and more.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Addition (+):</h2>
      <p>
        Think of addition as putting things together.{" "}
        {`It's like adding
        ingredients for a recipe, combining your pocket money with a friend's to
        buy a game, or calculating the total distance of a trip by adding the `}
        lengths of each leg.
      </p>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


let cookies = 5;
let brownies = 3;
let totalTreats = cookies + brownies; // totalTreats will be 8

console.log("You have", totalTreats, "treats in total.");
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h2>2. Subtraction (-):</h2>
      <p>
        Subtraction is like taking something away. Imagine calculating how much
        money you have left after buying something, figuring out the age
        difference between siblings, or finding the remaining time until a movie
        starts.
      </p>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


let startingMoney = 10;
let candyCost = 2;
let moneyLeft = startingMoney - candyCost; // moneyLeft will be 8

console.log("You have", moneyLeft, "dollars left after buying candy.");
          
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h2>3. Multiplication (*):</h2>
      <p>
        Multiplication is like repeating something a certain number of times. We
        use it to calculate areas (length times width), buy multiple items of
        the same price (price times quantity), or figure out how many steps you
        take in a walk (number of steps per minute times walking time).
      </p>
      <h3> Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


let pricePerApple = 1;
let applesBought = 4;
let totalPrice = pricePerApple * applesBought; // totalPrice will be 4

console.log("The apples cost", totalPrice, "dollars in total.");
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h2>4. Division (/):</h2>
      <p>
        Division is like splitting something into equal parts. We use it to
        share snacks with friends, calculate speed (distance divided by time),
        or find the price per item (total price divided by quantity).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Important Note</b>: Remember that dividing by zero is a no-no in
        JavaScript (and real life!). {`It's`} like trying to share a pizza with
        nobody. Be careful and handle those cases in your code.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


let totalCookies = 12;
let friendsSharing = 3;
let cookiesPerFriend = totalCookies / friendsSharing; // cookiesPerFriend will be 4

console.log("Each friend gets", cookiesPerFriend, "cookies.");
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h2>5. Modulus (%)</h2>
      <p>
        The modulus operator is a bit trickier. It gives you the remainder after
        a division. Think of it like the leftover candy after sharing with
        friends, the number of days remaining after dividing weeks, or the
        change you get back after paying with exact change.
      </p>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


let totalCandies = 17;
let friendsSharing = 4;
let leftoverCandy = totalCandies % friendsSharing; // leftoverCandy will be 1

console.log("There are", leftoverCandy, "candies leftover after sharing.");
          
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h2> 6. Increment (++) and Decrement (--) Operators:</h2>
      <p>
        These operators are like handy shortcuts for adding or subtracting one.
        Increment (++) adds 1, while decrement (--) subtracts 1. Imagine quickly
        adding one more item to your shopping cart (++) or taking one back
        because you changed your mind (--).
      </p>
      <h3>Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


let score = 0; // Starting score

// Adding 1 point
score++; // score becomes 1

// Taking 1 point away (oops!)
score--; // score becomes 0 again

console.log("Your current score is", score);
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        By understanding these operators and practicing with them, {`you'll`} be
        a whiz at performing calculations in JavaScript!

      <h2>Comparison Operators in Javascript </h2>
      <p>
        Comparison operators are the workhorses of conditional logic in
        JavaScript. They allow you to compare values and determine relationships
        between them, forming the foundation for making decisions in your code.
        These operators return either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>{" "}
        based on the comparison.
      </p>
      <h3>
        {`Here's`} a breakdown of each comparison operator and its nuances:
      </h3>
      <h2>Strict Equality (===):</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Explanation</b>: This operator checks for both value and type
        equality. It only returns true if the values on both sides are exactly
        the same and of the same type. {`It's`} the most reliable and
        recommended choice for most comparisons.
      </p>
      <h3> Code Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 10; // Both numbers

console.log(num1 === num2); // true (same value and type)

let str1 = "hello";
let str2 = "hello"; // Both strings

console.log(str1 === str2); // true (same value and type)

let num3 = 10;
let str3 = "10"; // Different types

console.log(num3 === str3); // false (different types, even though values seem similar)
          
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h2>2. Loose Equality (==):</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Explanation</b>: This operator performs type coercion before
        comparison. It might try to convert values from one type to another to
        see if they match. This can be convenient sometimes, but it can also
        lead to unexpected results due to coercion. Use it with caution!
      </p>
      <h3>Code Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


console.log(0 == false); // true (coerces 0 to false)
console.log("0" == false); // true (coerces "0" to 0)

let num4 = 10;
let str4 = "10"; // Different types

console.log(num4 == str4); // true (coerces "10" to 10)
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h2>3. Strict Inequality (!===):</h2>
      <p>
        <code>Explanation</code>: This operator is the inverse of strict
        equality. It returns true if the values are not equal in either value or
        type.
      </p>
      <h3>Code Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


console.log(10 !== "10"); // true (different types)
console.log("hello" !== "hello"); // false (same value and type)
          
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h2>4. Loose Inequality (!=):</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Explanation</b>: This operator is the inverse of loose equality. It
        returns true if the values are not equal, but be cautious due to
        potential type coercion as seen with loose equality.
      </p>
      <h3> Code Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
JavaScript
console.log(0 != false); // false (coerces 0 to false)
console.log("0" != false); // false (coerces "0" to 0)

let num5 = 10;
let str5 = "10"; // Different types

console.log(num5 != str5); // false (coerces "10" to 10)
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h2>5. Greater Than {`(>)`}:</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Explanation</b>: This operator returns <code>true</code> if the value
        on the left side is greater than the value on the right side. It works
        for numbers and strings (alphabetical order for strings).
      </p>
      <h3>Code Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


console.log(5 > 3); // true
console.log("apple" > "banana"); // false (alphabetical order)
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h2>6. Greater Than or Equal To {`(>=)`}:</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Explanation</b>: This operator returns true if the value on the left
        side is greater than or equal to the value on the right side.
      </p>
      <h3>Code Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


console.log(5 >= 3); // true
console.log(5 >= 5); // true
          
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h2>7. Less Than {`(<)`}:</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Explanation</b>: This operator returns true if the value on the left
        side is less than the value on the right side.
      </p>
      <h3>Code Example:</h3>

      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


console.log(3 < 5); // true
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <AdUnit />
      <h2>8. Less Than or Equal To {`(<=)`}:</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Explanation</b>: This operator returns true if the value on the left
        side is less than or equal to the value on the right side.
      </p>
      <h3> Code Example:</h3>

      <h2>JavaScript Developer Tips and Tricks</h2>
      <p>
        <code>Prioritize Strict Equality (===)</code>: {`It's`} generally
        recommended to use strict equality (===) for reliable comparisons,
        especially when dealing with different data types. This avoids potential
        surprises from type coercion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Understand Type Coercion</b>: Be aware of how JavaScript might
        convert values from one type to another during loose equality
        comparisons (==) and !=. This can lead to unexpected results if not
        anticipated.
      </p>
      <h3>Comparison with null and undefined:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          == and != can behave unexpectedly with null and undefined. {`It's`}{" "}
          often safer to use strict comparisons or specific checks like{" "}
          <code>x === null</code> or <code>x !== undefined</code>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Logical Operators in Javascript </h1>
      <p>
        Logical operators in JavaScript empower you to combine multiple
        conditions (comparisons or other expressions that evaluate to true or
        false) into a single, more complex expression. They become the building
        blocks for intricate decision-making within your programs. {`Let's`}{" "}
        delve into them with real-world examples and code:
      </p>
      <h2>1. AND Operator (&&):</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Real-world Example</b>: Imagine controlling access to a secure
        building. You need both a valid ID (like let hasValidID = true;) and a
        keycard (like let hasKeycard = true;) to enter.
      </p>
      <h3>Code Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


let hasValidID = true;
let hasKeycard = true;

if (hasValidID && hasKeycard) {
  console.log("Access granted!");
} else {
  console.log("Access denied. Please check your ID and keycard.");
}
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this code, the program only grants access{" "}
        {`(console.log("Access
        granted!"))`}{" "}
        if both hasValidID and hasKeycard are true.
      </p>
      <h2> 2. OR Operator (||):</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Real-world Example</b>: Deciding what to wear: You can wear a jacket
        if {`it's raining (like let isRaining = true;) or it's cold`} (like let
        isCold = false;).
      </p>
      <h3>Code Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


let isRaining = true;
let isCold = false;

if (isRaining || isCold) {
  console.log("Wear a jacket!");
} else {
  console.log("No jacket needed today.");
}
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Here, the program suggests wearing a jacket{" "}
        {`(console.log("Wear a
        jacket!"))`}{" "}
        if either isRaining or isCold is true.
      </p>
      <h2>3. NOT Operator (!):</h2>
      <p>
        Real-world Example: Checking if your library book is overdue. The book
        is overdue if {`it's`} not returned yet (like let isReturned = false;).
      </p>
      <h3>Code Example:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


let isReturned = false;

if (!isReturned) {
  console.log("Your book is overdue. Please return it soon!");
} else {
  console.log("Thank you for returning your book on time!");
}
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The program warns about the overdue book{" "}
        {`(console.log("Your book is
        overdue...")) if isReturned is not true`}{" "}
        (using the NOT operator !).
      </p>
      <h2>Key Points for JavaScript Developers:</h2>
      <p>
        {" "}
        <b>Evaluate from Left to Right</b>: Remember, logical operators are
        evaluated from left to right. Keep this in mind when crafting complex
        expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Short-Circuiting</b>: The && and || operators exhibit
        short-circuiting behavior. This means the program might not evaluate the
        entire expression if the result is already clear based on the left side.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Use Parentheses</b>: Use parentheses for clarity and to control the
        order of evaluation, especially in intricate expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Logical Operators with if Statements</b>: Combine logical operators
        effectively with if, else if, and switch statements to create
        sophisticated decision-making logic in your JavaScript programs.
      </p>
      <h2> Assignment Operator (=)</h2>
      <p>
        {" "}
        In JavaScript, the assignment operator (=) is fundamental for creating
        and manipulating variables. {`It's`} used to assign a value to a
        variable on its left side, based on the value on its right side.
      </p>
      <h3>Basic Usage:</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


let name = "Alice"; // Assigns the string "Alice" to the variable name
let age = 30;        // Assigns the number 30 to the variable age
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h3>In these examples:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>name and age become variables that can store values.</li>
        <li>
          The assignment operator (=) creates a link between the variable name
          (on the left) and the value (on the right).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Chained Assignments:</h3>
      <p>
        You can chain multiple assignments together, as long as the expressions
        on the right-hand side evaluate to a single value:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


let x = y = z = 10; // Assigns 10 to all three variables (x, y, and z)
          
          
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <h3>Important Considerations:</h3>
      <p>
        The assignment operator itself returns the assigned value. This allows
        for expressions like:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
//JavaScript


let result = (x = 5) + 3; // Assigns 5 to x, then result becomes 8 (5 + 3)
          
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <div className="button-container">
        <button onClick={() => (window.location.href = "/DataTypes")}>
          back
        </button>
        <button onClick={() => (window.location.href = "/comments")}>
          Next
        </button>
      </div>
