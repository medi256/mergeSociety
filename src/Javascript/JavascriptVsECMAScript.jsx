      <h1>JavaScript vs. ECMAScript: What's the Difference?</h1>
      <p>
        If you’ve been learning JavaScript, you might have come across the term
        “ECMAScript” and wondered what it means and how it relates to
        JavaScript. Are they the same thing? Is one more important than the
        other? Don’t worry; you’re not alone! This topic can be confusing at
        first, but once you understand the relationship between JavaScript and
        ECMAScript, it all makes sense.
      </p>

      <h2>Understanding JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to create dynamic
        and interactive content on websites. It’s the language you use when you
        want to make things happen in the browser, like responding to user
        actions, updating content without reloading the page, or creating
        animations. JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the web,
        alongside HTML and CSS.
      </p>

      <h2>So, What is ECMAScript?</h2>
      <p>
        ECMAScript is the standard that defines what JavaScript is and how it
        should work. Think of ECMAScript as the blueprint or rulebook for
        JavaScript. It’s a specification created by an organization called ECMA
        (European Computer Manufacturers Association) to ensure that different
        implementations of JavaScript across various browsers and environments
        are consistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every few years, ECMA releases a new version of the ECMAScript standard,
        which includes updates and new features for JavaScript. For example,
        ECMAScript 5 (ES5) introduced features like strict mode and JSON
        support, while ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015,
        brought in major enhancements like arrow functions, classes, and the
        <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> keywords.
      </p>

      <h2>JavaScript and ECMAScript: The Relationship</h2>
      <p>
        Here’s where it gets clearer: JavaScript is an implementation of the
        ECMAScript standard. In other words, JavaScript follows the rules and
        guidelines set out in ECMAScript. So, when a new version of ECMAScript
        is released, JavaScript engines (the programs that run JavaScript in
        your browser) are updated to support the new features and syntax defined
        by that version.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, when ECMAScript 6 was released, it introduced new syntax
        and features like the <code>class</code> keyword and template literals.
        JavaScript engines in browsers were then updated to understand and
        execute this new code. That’s why you might hear developers refer to
        JavaScript versions as “ES6,” “ES2017,” and so on—they’re referencing
        the ECMAScript version that defines the features available in
        JavaScript.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript is
        important for a few reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Compatibility:</b> When you write JavaScript code, it’s helpful to
          know which ECMAScript version it follows. This is especially important
          when working on projects that need to run on older browsers, which
          might not support the latest ECMAScript features. You might need to
          use tools like Babel to convert modern JavaScript into a version
          that’s compatible with older browsers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Learning and Using New Features:</b> As you continue learning
          JavaScript, you’ll come across new features introduced in recent
          ECMAScript versions. Knowing which features belong to which ECMAScript
          version helps you understand the history and evolution of the
          language, making it easier to learn and apply new concepts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Reading Documentation:</b> When reading JavaScript documentation or
          tutorials, you might see references to ECMAScript versions like “ES6”
          or “ES2020.” Understanding what these terms mean will help you better
          grasp the material and know what features are being discussed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <AdUnit />
      <h2>In Summary</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript and ECMAScript are closely related: JavaScript is the
        programming language we use to build web applications, and ECMAScript is
        the standard that defines the language. When you hear about new
        JavaScript features, those features are defined by the latest ECMAScript
        standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you continue your journey in web development, keep in mind that
        learning JavaScript means learning the features and rules defined by
        ECMAScript. Understanding this relationship will help you stay
        up-to-date with the language and write better, more compatible code.
