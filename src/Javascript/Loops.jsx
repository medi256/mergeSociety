      <h1>JavaScript Loops</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there! Today, we're going to learn about loops in JavaScript. Loops
        are a way to repeat a piece of code several times. This is really
        helpful when we need to do the same thing over and over again, like
        going through a list of items or doing a repeated task.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine you have a list of tasks to do. Instead of writing the same code
        for each task, you can use a loop to do it for you. There are different
        types of loops in JavaScript, and each one has its own way of working.
        Let's take a look at them.
      </p>

      <h2>for Loops</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>for</code> loop is one of the most common loops in JavaScript.
        It lets us run a piece of code a set number of times. The{" "}
        <code>for</code> loop has three main parts: initialization, condition,
        and increment. Let's break it down:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
// Code to be executed
}
    `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Initialization:</b> This is where we start by setting a variable,
          usually a counter. It runs once at the beginning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Condition:</b> The loop keeps running as long as this condition is
          true. It checks this before each loop.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Increment:</b> This part updates the counter after each loop. It
          runs after each loop.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Think of a <code>for</code> loop like a countdown timer. Let's say you
        set the timer to 10 seconds. The initialization is setting the timer to
        10. The condition is checking if the timer is above 0, and the increment
        is counting down by 1 second each time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a{" "}
        <code>for</code> loop:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
console.log(i);
}
// Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, the loop starts with <code>i</code> set to 1. The loop
        runs as long as <code>i</code> is less than or equal to 5. After each
        loop, <code>i</code> is increased by 1. The loop prints the value of{" "}
        <code>i</code> in each round.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breaking it down:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Initialization:</b> We start by setting <code>i</code> to 1. This
            happens once at the start.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Condition:</b> The loop checks if <code>{`i <= 5`}</code>. If
            true, the loop continues; if false, it stops.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Increment:</b> After each loop, <code>i++</code> increases{" "}
            <code>i</code> by 1.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <AdUnit />
      <h2>while Loops</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>while</code> loop is another type of loop. It keeps running as
        long as a condition is true. Unlike the <code>for</code> loop, the{" "}
        <code>while</code> loop only has a condition. Let's break it down:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
while (condition) {
// Code to be executed
}
    `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The <code>while</code> loop works like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Condition:</b> The loop keeps running as long as this condition is
          true. It checks the condition before each loop.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Think of a <code>while</code> loop like a traffic light. The light stays
        green as long as there are no cars waiting. The condition is whether
        there are cars waiting. If the condition is true (no cars waiting), the
        light stays green.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a{" "}
        <code>while</code> loop:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
let i = 1;

while (i <= 5) {
console.log(i);
i++;
}
// Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, the loop starts with <code>i</code> set to 1. The loop
        runs as long as <code>i</code> is less than or equal to 5. After each
        loop, <code>i</code> is increased by 1. The loop prints the value of{" "}
        <code>i</code> in each round.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breaking it down:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Initialization:</b> We start by setting <code>i</code> to 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Condition:</b> The loop checks if <code>{`i <= 5`}</code>. If
            true, the loop continues; if false, it stops.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Code Block:</b> Inside the loop, <code>console.log(i)</code>{" "}
            prints the current value of <code>i</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Increment:</b> After printing, <code>i++</code> increases{" "}
            <code>i</code> by 1.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>do-while Loops</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>do-while</code> loop is like the <code>while</code> loop, but
        it always runs the code block at least once before checking the
        condition. Let's break it down:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
do {
// Code to be executed
} while (condition);
    `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The <code>do-while</code> loop works like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Code Block:</b> The code inside the <code>do</code> block runs
          first, before checking the condition.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Condition:</b> After running the code block, the condition is
          checked. If it's true, the loop runs again.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Think of a <code>do-while</code> loop like eating your favorite candy.
        You will eat the candy at least once, and then check if you have more.
        If you do, you eat another piece. The code block is eating the candy,
        and the condition is checking if there's more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a{" "}
        <code>do-while</code> loop:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
let i = 1;

do {
console.log(i);
i++;
} while (i <= 5);
// Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, the code block inside the <code>do</code> section runs
        first, printing the value of <code>i</code>. After that, the condition
        is checked. If it's true, the loop runs again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breaking it down:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Initialization:</b> We start by setting <code>i</code> to 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Code Block:</b> Inside the loop, <code>console.log(i)</code>{" "}
            prints the current value of <code>i</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Increment:</b> After printing, <code>i++</code> increases{" "}
            <code>i</code> by 1.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Condition:</b> After running the code block, the loop checks if{" "}
            <code>{`i <= 5`}</code>. If true, the loop continues; if false, it
            stops.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>for...in Loops</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>for...in</code> loop is used to go through the properties of
        an object. This loop is useful when you want to access the keys of an
        object. Let's break it down:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
for (key in object) {
// Code to be executed
}
    `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The <code>for...in</code> loop works like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Key:</b> The loop goes through the keys of the object, assigning
          each key to the loop variable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Code Block:</b> Inside the loop, you can access the key and its
          value.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Think of a <code>for...in</code> loop like looking through the drawers
        of a dresser. Each drawer is a key, and the contents inside the drawer
        are the values. You open each drawer (key) one by one and see what's
        inside (value).
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example where we go through the properties of an object using
        a <code>for...in</code> loop:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
const person = {
name: 'Alice',
age: 30,
city: 'New York'
};

for (let key in person) {
console.log(key + ': ' + person[key]);
}
// Output:
// name: Alice
// age: 30
// city: New York
    `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, the loop goes through each key in the{" "}
        <code>person</code> object and prints the key along with its value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breaking it down:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Object:</b> We have an object <code>person</code> with properties{" "}
            <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>city</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Key:</b> The loop variable <code>key</code> takes on the value of
            each key in the object.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Code Block:</b> Inside the loop,{" "}
            <code>console.log(key + ': ' + person[key])</code> prints the key
            and its value.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <AdUnit />
      <h2>for...of Loops</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>for...of</code> loop is used to go through iterable objects
        like arrays, strings, and sets. This loop is useful when you want to
        access the values of an iterable. Let's break it down:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
for (element of iterable) {
// Code to be executed
}
    `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The <code>for...of</code> loop works like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Element:</b> The loop goes through the values of the iterable,
          assigning each value to the loop variable.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Code Block:</b> Inside the loop, you can access the current value
          of the iterable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Think of a <code>for...of</code> loop like reading a book. Each page is
        an element, and you go through each page one by one. The loop variable
        is the current page you are reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example where we go through an array using a{" "}
        <code>for...of</code> loop:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let number of numbers) {
console.log(number);
}
// Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, the loop goes through each value in the{" "}
        <code>numbers</code> array and prints the value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Breaking it down:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Iterable:</b> We have an array <code>numbers</code> with values
            1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Element:</b> The loop variable <code>number</code> takes on the
            value of each element in the array.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Code Block:</b> Inside the loop, <code>console.log(number)</code>{" "}
            prints the current value.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Loops are a powerful and essential part of JavaScript. They help us do
        repetitive tasks and handle collections of data easily. By learning
        about the different types of loops and how they work, you'll be able to
        write better and shorter code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try using these loops in your own projects and see how they work in
        different situations. Happy coding!
