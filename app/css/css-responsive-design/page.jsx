      <h1>Responsive Design and Best Practices</h1>
      <p>
        Responsive design is an approach to web development that ensures web
        pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.
        It's essential for providing a seamless user experience across different
        platforms, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Principles of Responsive Design</h2>

      <h3>Fluid Layouts</h3>
      <p>
        Use fluid layouts that adjust and adapt to the size of the user's
        viewport. Avoid fixed-width layouts that may not scale properly on
        different devices.
      </p>

      <h3>Media Queries</h3>
      <p>
        Utilize CSS media queries to apply different styles based on the
        characteristics of the device, such as screen width, height, and
        orientation. This allows you to create responsive designs that adapt to
        various screen sizes and resolutions.
      </p>

      <h3>Flexible Images and Media</h3>
      <p>
        Ensure images and media elements are responsive by setting their maximum
        width to 100% of the container and using the appropriate CSS properties
        to control their size and aspect ratio.
      </p>

      <h3>Mobile-First Approach</h3>
      <p>
        Start designing for mobile devices first, then progressively enhance the
        layout and functionality for larger screens. This ensures a better user
        experience on smaller devices and prevents the need for excessive
        overrides and adjustments.
      </p>

      <h3>Content Priority</h3>
      <p>
        Prioritize content based on its importance and relevance to the user.
        Use techniques like content stacking and hiding less critical elements
        on smaller screens to improve readability and usability.
      </p>

      <h2>Best Practices for Responsive Design</h2>
      <p>
        Here are some additional best practices to follow when designing
        responsive websites:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Test your website on various devices and browsers to ensure
          compatibility and consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optimize images and media files for faster loading times on mobile
          devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use relative units like percentages and ems for sizing elements to
          maintain scalability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement touch-friendly navigation and interactive elements for
          touchscreen devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Design for accessibility by ensuring text is readable, buttons are
          easily clickable, and content is navigable with keyboard and screen
          readers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Regularly update and maintain your website to adapt to changing
          technology and user needs.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples</h2>

      <p>Below are examples demonstrating responsive design principles:</p>

      <h3>Fluid Layout</h3>
      <p>
        This example uses a fluid layout that adjusts based on the size of the
        viewport:
      </p>
      <iframe
        width="100%"
        height="300"
        srcDoc={`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    .container {
      width: 100%;
      max-width: 800px;
      margin: 0 auto;
      padding: 0 20px;
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <p>This is a fluid layout that adjusts based on the size of the viewport.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>`}
        title="Fluid Layout Example"
      ></iframe>

      <h3>Media Queries</h3>
      <p>
        This example uses media queries to apply different styles for different
        screen sizes:
      </p>
      <iframe
        width="100%"
        height="300"
        srcDoc={`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    .container {
      width: 100%;
      max-width: 800px;
      margin: 0 auto;
      padding: 20px;
      box-sizing: border-box;
      background-color: #f0f0f0;
    }

    @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
      .container {
        background-color: #e0e0e0;
      }
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <p>This example uses media queries to apply different styles for different screen sizes.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>`}
        title="Media Queries Example"
      ></iframe>

      <p>
        By following these principles and best practices, you can create
        responsive designs that provide a consistent and enjoyable experience
        for users across all devices and screen sizes.
