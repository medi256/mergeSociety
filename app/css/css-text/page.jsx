        <h1>The Magical Art of Styling Text in CSS</h1>
        <p>
          Styling text in CSS is like giving your words a magical makeover! You
          can transform their appearance, add emphasis, and create visually
          stunning designs. In this section, we'll explore the fascinating world
          of text styling in CSS and learn how to use different properties to
          style your text elements. Let's embark on this text styling adventure!
        </p>

        <h2>Word Spacing</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>word-spacing</code> property allows you to adjust the space
          between words in your text. You can use positive or negative values to
          increase or decrease the spacing. Here's an example:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="CSS" style={docco}>
              {`
p {
  word-spacing: 5px; /* Adds 5 pixels of space between each word */
}
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          In the code above, we set the <code>word-spacing</code> property to 5
          pixels, creating a noticeable gap between each word. This technique
          can be used to create a unique layout, improve readability, or add
          emphasis to certain phrases or keywords. Play with different values to
          find the perfect spacing that enhances the visual appeal and
          readability of your text.
        </p>

        <h2>Letter Spacing</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>letter-spacing</code> property allows you to adjust the
          space between individual letters in your text. You can use positive or
          negative values to increase or decrease the spacing. Here's an
          example:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="CSS" style={docco}>
              {`
h1 {
  letter-spacing: 2px; /* Adds 2 pixels of space between each letter */
}
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          In the code above, we set the <code>letter-spacing</code> property to
          2 pixels, creating a slight gap between each letter. This technique is
          often used to create unique visual effects, add emphasis to headings,
          or improve the readability of tightly spaced letters. Experiment with
          different values to find the perfect letter spacing that complements
          your design and enhances readability.
        </p>

        <h2>Line Height</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>line-height</code> property allows you to adjust the spacing
          between lines of text. It determines the distance between the
          baselines of adjacent lines. You can use numeric values, percentages,
          or keywords like
          <code>normal</code>. Here's an example:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="CSS" style={docco}>
              {`
p {
  line-height: 1.5; /* Sets the line height to 1.5 times the font size */
}
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          In the code above, we set the <code>line-height</code> property to
          1.5, creating a comfortable spacing between lines of text. This
          improves readability and makes the text easier to scan. You can adjust
          the line height to create tighter or looser spacing, depending on your
          design needs. A higher line height generally improves readability,
          while a lower line height can create a more compact and dense
          appearance.
        </p>

        <h2>Text Alignment</h2>
        <p>
          The <code>text-align</code> property allows you to align your text
          within its container. You can choose from values like{" "}
          <code>left</code>,<code>right</code>, <code>center</code>, or{" "}
          <code>justify</code>. Here's an example:
        </p>

        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="CSS" style={docco}>
              {`
div {
  text-align: justify; /* Justifies the text within the container */
}
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
          In the code above, we set the <code>text-align</code> property to
          <code>justify</code>, aligning the text to both the left and right
          edges of the container. This creates a clean, justified alignment,
          commonly used for body text or paragraphs. You can also center text
          using <code>text-align: center</code>
          to create a balanced layout or align text to the left or right to
          achieve different visual effects. Text alignment plays a crucial role
          in creating visually appealing and readable designs.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Here is a table for all the values of <code>text-align</code> property
        </h2>
        <table border="1">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Value</th>

            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>left</td>
              <td>Aligns the text to the left</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>right</td>
              <td>Aligns the text to the right</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>center</td>
              <td>Centers the text horizontally</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>justify</td>
              <td>
                Expands the spaces between words so that the lines of text touch
                both sides of the container
              </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
