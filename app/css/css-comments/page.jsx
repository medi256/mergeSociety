      <h1>The Power of Comments in CSS</h1>
      <p>
        Comments are like hidden notes in your CSS code. They allow you to add
        explanations, provide context, or leave reminders for yourself or other
        developers working on the code. Comments are ignored by the browser and
        do not affect the styling of your web page. In this section, we'll
        explore the importance of comments and learn how to use them effectively
        in your CSS code. Let's begin!
      </p>

      <h2>Single-Line Comments</h2>
      <p>
        Single-line comments are denoted by the <code>/*</code> symbol at the
        beginning and the <code>*/</code> symbol at the end. Everything in
        between these symbols is considered a comment and will be ignored by the
        browser. Here's an example:
      </p>

      <code>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="CSS" style={docco}>
              {`
/* This is a single-line comment */
/* You can use comments to explain your code */
/* Comments are ignored by the browser */
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
      </code>

      <p>
        In the code above, we've added three single-line comments. These
        comments provide explanations or notes about the code. They are useful
        for documenting your code, explaining complex sections, or leaving
        reminders for future reference.
      </p>

      <h2>Multi-Line Comments</h2>
      <p>
        Multi-line comments are used when you need to include a longer
        explanation or comment that spans multiple lines. They start with the{" "}
        <code>/*</code>
        symbol and end with the <code>*/</code> symbol, enclosing the entire
        block of text. Here's an example:
      </p>

      <code>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="CSS" style={docco}>
              {`
/*
  This is a multi-line comment
  You can include multiple lines of text
  within the comment block
*/
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
      </code>

      <p>
        In the code above, we've added a multi-line comment that spans three
        lines. Multi-line comments are useful when you need to provide detailed
        explanations, document complex code sections, or include references or
        credits for code snippets.
      </p>

      <h2>Commenting Out Code</h2>
      <p>
        Comments can also be used to temporarily disable or "comment out"
        certain sections of your code. This is useful when you want to test
        different styles or temporarily hide certain rules without deleting
        them. Here's an example:
      </p>

      <code>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="CSS" style={docco}>
              {`
/*
  This rule is temporarily disabled
  .highlight {
    color: red;
  }
*/
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
      </code>

      <p>
        In the code above, we've commented out the rule for the{" "}
        <code>.highlight</code>
        class. This means that the code within the comment block will be ignored
        by the browser. You can use this technique to experiment with different
        styles or to temporarily disable certain rules while troubleshooting.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Best Practices for Comments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use comments to explain complex or non-obvious sections of your code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include comments to provide context or reasoning behind certain design
          decisions or choices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use comments to leave reminders or notes for yourself or other
          developers working on the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep comments concise, clear, and focused on providing useful
          information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Update comments when you make changes to the code to ensure they
          remain accurate and relevant.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practice Time!</h2>
      <p>
        Now it's time to put your knowledge into practice! Open your code editor
        and create a new CSS file. Let's explore the power of comments:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Add single-line comments to explain different sections of your CSS
          code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Include multi-line comments to provide detailed explanations or
          references for complex code blocks.
        </li>
        <li>
          Experiment with commenting out certain rules to see how it affects the
          styling of your web page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Follow the best practices for comments to ensure your code is
          well-documented and easy to understand for yourself and other
          developers.
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        Remember, comments are an important tool for code documentation and
        collaboration. They help improve code readability, facilitate
        troubleshooting, and make it easier for other developers to understand
        your code. Happy coding!
