      <h1>The Art of Fonts in CSS</h1>
      <p>
        Fonts are like the brushstrokes that bring your web designs to life!
        They play a crucial role in shaping the overall look and feel of your
        website, influencing readability, aesthetics, and user experience. In
        this section, we'll explore the magical world of fonts in CSS and learn
        how to style your text with elegance and precision. Let's begin our
        typographic journey!
      </p>

      <h2>Font Family</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>font-family</code> property is like a painter's palette,
        allowing you to choose the typeface for your text. You can select from a
        wide range of font families, including serif, sans-serif, monospace, and
        more. Here's an example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="CSS" style={docco}>
            {`
p {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the code above, we set the <code>font-family</code> property to
        <code>Arial</code>, with a fallback to <code>sans-serif</code>. The
        browser will use Arial if it's available, and if not, it will default to
        a sans-serif font. This ensures that your text remains legible and
        consistent across different devices and browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to explore different font families values, you can refer to
        this link:{" "}
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family">
          Mozilla Developer Network
        </a>
        .
      </p>

      <h2>Font Size</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>font-size</code> property allows you to adjust the size of
        your text, making it larger or smaller. You can use various units, such
        as pixels (px), ems (relative to the parent element's font size), or
        percentages (%). Here's an example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="CSS" style={docco}>
            {`
p {
  font-size: 16px;
}
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the code above, we set the <code>font-size</code> property to 16
        pixels, making the text within paragraphs appear at that size. You can
        experiment with different font sizes to find the perfect balance between
        readability and aesthetics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't panic if you don't understand units like (px), (%), and (ems). We
        will cover them more in the Units topic, explaining what each means and
        how they work. For now, try adding any number you know followed by the
        (px) keyword like this: (font-size: 20px;). Your text will increase or
        decrease in size according to what you provide. Play around with it and
        see in the browser.
      </p>

      <h2>Font Weight</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>font-weight</code> property allows you to adjust the thickness
        or boldness of your text. You can use numeric values (100 to 900) or
        keywords like <code>normal</code> and <code>bold</code>. Here's an
        example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="CSS" style={docco}>
            {`
p {
  font-weight: bold;
}
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the code above, we set the <code>font-weight</code> property to
        <code>bold</code>, making the text within paragraphs appear bold. You
        can use different font weights to create emphasis, highlight important
        text, or add visual hierarchy to your designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can play around with your code to experiment with how your text
        changes. Add bold values, use numbers from 100 to 900, and experiment
        freely.
      </p>

      <h2>Font Style</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>font-style</code> property allows you to add stylistic
        variations to your text. You can choose between normal, italic, or
        oblique styles. Here's an example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="CSS" style={docco}>
            {`
p {
  font-style: italic;
}
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the code above, we set the <code>font-style</code> property to
        <code>italic</code>, making the text within paragraphs appear in italic
        style. Italic text is often used to emphasize certain passages or to
        convey a softer tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Experiment with other values as well. Try adding them and see how your
        text will appear.
      </p>

      <h2>Text Decoration</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>text-decoration</code> property allows you to add decorative
        elements to your text, such as underlines, overlines, or line-throughs.{" "}
        Here's an example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="CSS" style={docco}>
            {`
a {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the code above, we set the <code>text-decoration</code> property to
        <code>underline</code>, adding an underline to the text within anchor (
        <code>a</code>) elements. Text decorations can be used to highlight
        important links or emphasize specific text.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Here is a table of values you can use to achieve different decorations.
      </h3>
      <table border="1">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Value</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>underline</td>
            <td>Adds a single line under the text content.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>overline</td>
            <td>Adds a single line above the text content.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>line-through</td>
            <td>
              Draws a line through the middle of the text content
              (strikethrough).
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>none</td>
            <td>Removes any existing text decoration (default).</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>blink (not recommended)</td>
            <td>Makes the text blink (avoid due to accessibility concerns).</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>initial</td>
            <td>
              Sets the decoration to the default value specified by the user
              agent.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>inherit</td>
            <td>Inherits the decoration value from the parent element.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>dotted</td>
            <td>
              Draws a line with small dots along the baseline of the text.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>dashed</td>
            <td>Draws a line with dashes along the baseline of the text.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>wavy</td>
            <td>Draws a wavy line under the text content.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      
      <h2>Text Transform</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>text-transform</code> property allows you to control the
        capitalization of your text. You can choose between uppercase,
        lowercase, and capitalize options. Here's an example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="CSS" style={docco}>
            {`
p {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the code above, we set the <code>text-transform</code> property to
        <code>uppercase</code>, converting all text within paragraphs to
        uppercase. Text transformation can be used to create visual emphasis or
        to maintain consistency in headings or labels.
      </p>
      <h3>Common text-transform values:</h3>
      <table border="1">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Value</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>none</td>
            <td>No capitalization or transformation.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>capitalize</td>
            <td>Transforms the first character of each word to uppercase.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>uppercase</td>
            <td>Transforms all characters to uppercase.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>lowercase</td>
            <td>Transforms all characters to lowercase.</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>Line Height</h2>
      <p>
        The <code>line-height</code> property allows you to adjust the spacing
        between lines of text, also known as leading. You can use numeric values
        or keywords like <code>normal</code>. Here's an example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="CSS" style={docco}>
            {`
p {
  line-height: 1.5;
}
          `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the code above, we set the <code>line-height</code> property to 1.5,
        increasing the spacing between lines of text within paragraphs.
        Adjusting the line height can improve readability and make your text
        more visually appealing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try to adjust and experiment on your browser. Play around with different
        numbers and see: the higher the value, the more the space increases; the
        lower the number, the less the space.
      </p>
