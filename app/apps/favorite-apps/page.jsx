        </h2>

        <p>
          Welcome to what is both an end and a new beginning: the highly
          anticipated series finale of my Top Android App series. For those who
          might’ve missed the announcement, last month I posted what will be, at
          least for now, the final installment of my monthly regular “Top
          Android Apps” videos. Yes—after over eight years (can you believe it?)
          of highlighting the freshest, most useful, and occasionally wackiest
          Android apps, I decided the time had come for a pause. Why? Because
          after so many years, my hope is to bring you new kinds of tech
          content—fresher, even more helpful, and hopefully destined to help the
          channel grow to new heights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, don’t panic—the app content <strong>isn’t</strong> disappearing
          altogether! I still plan to share app-related videos, but they’ll look
          a bit different and won’t be arriving every month like clockwork. As a
          tribute to what’s truly been an amazing chapter on the channel, I
          wanted to mark this series finale by sharing one special video—and
          now, article—highlighting{" "}
          <strong>my absolute 20 favorite apps of all time</strong>.
        </p>
        <h2>Not Your Average App List—Uniqueness Required!</h2>
        <p>
          If you were expecting a list filled with the likes of YouTube, Google
          Chrome, or Gmail, think again. This isn't about the built-in staples.
          These apps all bring something distinct to the table – they're unique,
          have stood the test of time, and yes, every single app here is
          something I still actively use on my devices, in some way or another.
          For a bit of added fun, I'm introducing each app in the order that I
          first featured it on my channel. Get ready for a nostalgic ride!
        </p>
        <h2>1. Nova Launcher (Featured September 2015)</h2>
        <p>
          It all starts with a classic: <strong>Nova Launcher</strong>. If
          you’re into home screen customization, Nova Launcher will already be a
          household name. While I don’t currently use it as my permanent
          launcher, it’s still my go-to for tinkering with new setups for my App
          Palette or for recreating configurations in my “Best Android Setups”
          videos. Its customization options are second to none and even after
          all these years, I’m still a huge fan.
        </p>
        <h2>2. Bring! (Featured December 2016)</h2>
        <p>
          Next up, another time-tested legend: <strong>Bring!</strong> This
          shopping list app has barely changed its look in eight years, which
          speaks volumes—it was ahead of its time. Bring! offers a beautiful
          tile-based interface to quickly add and remove groceries, but its
          killer feature is real-time sharing. My wife and I both have the same
          synced list, so, for example, if she adds bread while I’m
          contemplating cereal in the supermarket aisle, my list updates
          instantly. Couple goals, right?
        </p>
        <h2>3. KWGT (Featured April 2018)</h2>
        <p>
          For all custom widget aficionados: <strong>KWGT</strong> is an OG app
          that I've used for nearly a decade (yes, that long!) even though I
          never formally featured the app itself in a Top Apps episode. However,
          KWGT packs appeared on my channel frequently—such as the first one
          back in April 2018. I still use it constantly; for example, on
          basically every home screen I build, and my current favorite setup
          uses “Widget Three” from the Waffle for KWGT pack.
        </p>
        <h2>4. Solid Explorer (Featured April 2018)</h2>
        <p>
          While most Android phones now ship with built-in file managers,{" "}
          <strong>Solid Explorer</strong> remains my gold standard for
          navigating, organizing, and transferring files. I install it on every
          phone. Compared to many stock file explorers, Solid Explorer’s
          flexibility continues to win me over.

        <h2>5. Frog Weather Shortcut (Featured after April 2018)</h2>
        <p>
          If you’re admiring the weather widget on my home screen, know that it
          links to a hidden gem: <strong>Frog Weather Shortcut</strong>. Unlike
          the main Google Weather app (which isn't independently downloadable),
          this app jumps you straight to the whimsical Google Weather page,
          complete with its iconic mascot frog. You get quick access from
          widgets or the app drawer, and I still prefer its playful interface
          over Google’s newer alternatives.
        </p>
        <h2>6. Screen Dimmer (Featured July 2019)</h2>
        <p>
          There are times when even your phone’s dimmest screen setting is still{" "}
          <em>way</em> too bright—especially at night!{" "}
          <strong>Screen Dimmer</strong> lowers your screen’s brightness beyond
          Android’s normal settings, and notably also dims the status and
          navigation bars, which similar apps neglect. I temporarily stopped
          using it when Android 12 introduced Extra Dim, but Android 15’s
          changes led me back—Screen Dimmer remains the best, especially on my
          S25 Ultra.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Memorigi (Featured Ongoing)</h2>
        <p>
          In the realm of to-do and reminder apps, <strong>Memorigi</strong> is
          the holy grail, at least for Android users. I’ve spent years searching
          for a replacement—no app matches its clean design or allows custom
          snooze durations right from the notification. It’s an absolute
          essential for every device I own. The only catch? No iOS support… so
          I’m quietly starting work on a cross-platform reminder app. Keep an
          eye out!
        </p>
        <h2>
          8. CyberGhost VPN &raquo; Sponsored Feature (Featured Various Times)
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>CyberGhost VPN</strong> deserves mention for safeguarding your
          privacy. If you ever connect to public WiFi—a café, airport, or
          hotel—your data is vulnerable to hackers, ISPs, and snooping websites.
          Flick on CyberGhost and, boom, your traffic is encrypted and your IP
          address concealed. Bonus: it unlocks geo-blocked content! For example,
          if "Inception" isn't available on Netflix Australia but streams in the
          US, just switch your virtual location and start watching. CyberGhost
          works across Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, Smart TVs, and consoles;
          protects up to seven devices; and is currently offering an 84%
          discount with four free months (plus a 45-day money back guarantee).
          Over 38 million users and a stellar Trustpilot rating can’t be wrong.
        </p>
        <h2>9. BuzzKill (Featured January 2021)</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>BuzzKill</strong> changes the game for notification
          management—it lets you control how (and how often) your phone notifies
          you. While I didn’t use it much at first, I came back, and now it’s
          indispensable, especially for reigning in overzealous fitness and
          health apps. My Ultra Human ring sends a barrage of notifications, but
          BuzzKill lets me keep only the useful ones: training updates and
          battery alerts. No more "Stop drinking coffee!" nagging—thank you,
          BuzzKill!
        </p>
        <h2>10. Shizuku (Featured Mid-2021)</h2>
        <p>
          The unsung hero for Android tinkerers: <strong>Shizuku</strong> lets
          you grant ADB permissions directly from your phone, serving as a
          “permission middleman” for other apps. Back in mid-2021, only a
          handful of apps supported Shizuku, but that number has exploded.
          There’s even a curated list of compatible apps for extra nerd-cred
          (I’ll drop that in the description).
        </p>
        <h2>11. Notesnook (Featured Various Times)</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Notesnook</strong> is my favorite cross-device, privacy-first
          note-taking app. Its clean interface, deep features, web access, and
          support for Android/iOS make it my top choice—plus it’s open source!
          Ideal for securely storing notes or brainstorming your next big idea.
        </p>
        <h2>12. Listy (Featured March 2022)</h2>
        <p>
          For cataloging books, movies, or anything list-worthy,{" "}
          <strong>Listy</strong> is my specialist pick. It not only stores your
          lists but automatically populates them with supplementary info, like
          book covers and movie posters, making them visually rich and easy to
          navigate. I use it primarily to track my reading year by year. Shame
          there’s no cross-device sync yet, but the aesthetic payoff keeps me
          hooked.
        </p>
        <h2>13. Palette (My Own App)</h2>
        <p>
          Time to indulge in a little self-promotion: <strong>Palette</strong>{" "}
          was my very first app and remains one of my proudest projects. Born
          from the struggle of managing community-shared home screen setups,
          Palette allows users to upload, share, and retrieve custom setups{" "}
          <em>with all associated assets included</em>. This transformed my
          workflow from a mess of Google Drive links to a one-stop, app-centric
          solution. To date: over 750,000 installs and 60,000 active
          users—mind-blowing!
        </p>
        <h2>14. SMS Backup & Restore (Featured Late 2022)</h2>
        <p>
          As someone who frequently hops between devices,{" "}
          <strong>SMS Backup & Restore</strong> is my savior for maintaining my
          message history—especially since Google’s own Messages app still lacks
          robust backup support. I was using this well before it ever got a
          feature on the channel.
        </p>
        <h2>15. Snipped (Podcast App)</h2>
        <p>
          I may not listen to as many podcasts as I’d like, but{" "}
          <strong>Snipped</strong> wins hands-down in design and features.
          Although sync between devices can be a bit flaky (it often forgets my
          podcast progress), unless a competitor matches its looks and
          reliability, it’ll remain my default audio companion.
        </p>
        <h2>16. Shelf (My Own App)</h2>
        <p>
          Next up is <strong>Shelf</strong>, another of my creations. Where
          Palette is for home screen setups, Shelf is for discovering and
          sharing app recommendations. I use it constantly myself, and our team
          is adding new app suggestions daily—making it ideal for anyone
          lamenting the end of this series but still eager to find new Android
          treasures.
        </p>
        <h2>17. Tasker (Featured 2023)</h2>
        <p>
          The ultimate automation app: <strong>Tasker</strong>. I’ve only really
          dived in recently, but already have three spot-on automations: one
          adds an intensity slider whenever I activate my phone’s torch (super
          practical!); another organizes the downloads folder automatically; and
          the last configures ADB Wi-Fi and Shizuku permissions on every reboot
          (no computer needed). Want to try these for yourself? There’s a full
          how-to video for those interested.
        </p>
        <h2>18. Dual Wallpaper</h2>
        <p>
          A problem every vibrant wallpaper lover knows: you don’t want to be
          blinded at night. <strong>Dual Wallpaper</strong> lets you set a
          vibrant design for daytime and a dimmer, eye-friendly image for
          nighttime or dark mode. The switch happens automatically as your
          system theme changes, keeping your eyes comfortable 24/7.
        </p>
        <h2>19. Drops (My Own Icon Pack)</h2>
        <p>
          If you’re eyeing the cute app icons on my home screen—yep, that’s{" "}
          <strong>Drops</strong>, my own rebooted icon pack! The original
          version died off in 2017, but my team and I brought it back with
          frequent updates and a growing number of supported icons. It’s on
          every phone I own now.
        </p>
        <h2>20. Lumina Walls (My Own Wallpaper App)</h2>
        <p>
          In my endless quest for the perfect wallpaper, I built{" "}
          <strong>Lumina Walls</strong>. Every wallpaper in the app is
          handpicked (by me), with fresh additions daily and plenty of free
          options (over 850 at the time of writing). There are also premium
          collections designed specifically to match my ever-changing tastes.
          Beyond the looks, Lumina Walls is a joy to use, with smooth animations
          and a polished interface that stands out from the dull, clunky
          competition. It's easily my most-used app of all.
        </p>
        <h2>21. LocalSend</h2>
        <p>
          One bonus for you: <strong>LocalSend</strong> is like an enhanced,
          universal version of Quick Share or AirDrop. Unlike those services, it
          works seamlessly across all platforms—even iOS and MacOS! The only
          snag is that it can't continuously run in the background on mobile, so
          you'll need to open it whenever you want to transfer files. Still,
          it's nearly flawless once running, and unless Apple or Google bring
          true universality, LocalSend is my everyday solution for quick
          device-to-device transfers.
        </p>
