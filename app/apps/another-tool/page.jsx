        <p>
          Tools. Some folks love them, others secretly despise them, and plenty
          just binge-watch reviews on YouTube—maybe even on my own channel! But
          today, we're diving into the tools I genuinely use. That might
          surprise some people, because I have a reputation: I'm that YouTuber
          who doesn't clutter their daily workflow with a thousand trendy
          gadgets. Yep, I'm known for keeping my Mac setup absolutely minimal.
          My “boring” setup isn't some badge of stubborn minimalism; it's a
          genuine philosophy. In fact, I have a hard rule: if I ever need a new
          machine from the Apple Store, I challenge myself to get it set up and
          productive—just as I like it—in under an hour, from scratch. That’s
          how little I actually rely on stuff outside the basics. You never know
          when disaster might strike, so this principle is my safety net.
        </p>

        <p>
          But... times change. Recently, I have been experimenting more. Go
          ahead—raise those eyebrows! While I tend to keep my digital space on
          “boring mode,” I can’t resist the urge to try new things and keep up
          with what’s happening in tech. What surprises me is that lately, a
          bunch of the tools I’ve dabbled with have <em>actually stuck</em>. And
          it’s not just developer tools on today’s list. This article is a bit
          different from my usual content focused just on devs—I’ll be mixing in
          non-dev tools too. Dev tool, not-dev tool, dev tool, not-dev
          tool—every dev is also a person, after all, and a lot of these will be
          useful no matter who you are.
        </p>

        <p>
          Interested in more of this kind of breakdown? Let me know, because
          I’ve got a ton more to share in future content. But for now, let’s
          deep-dive into my new favorite tools I use every single day.
        </p>

        <h2>Drizzle ORM: The “Tailwind” of SQL</h2>
        <p>
          First up is a developer tool, and this one is a real game-changer for
          anyone who works with TypeScript on the server side:{" "}
          <strong>Drizzle</strong>. If you’re a full stack TypeScript dev—or
          even just dabbling on the backend—you may have heard of other ORMs
          like Prisma. Prisma’s got a solid reputation, pushing the boundaries
          for type safety and robust ORM workflows. But Drizzle? It takes
          everything good about modern ORMs and packages it in a minimal, fast,
          and arguably <em>more reliable</em> experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’ve been using Drizzle as my ORM of choice across projects for over a
          year. Aside from the fact that their testimonials section once
          included a tongue-in-cheek “Drizzle sucks—I love Drizzle—I hate
          Drizzle” (which shows their sense of humor), Drizzle really delivers.
          They call it the “Tailwind of SQL,” which I think is spot-on: fast
          (Prisma in Bun gives you about 1.4 MB/s, Drizzle clocks in around 10),
          with sleek syntax that works in every environment I need.
        </p>

        <h3>Studio Mode: Database Admin, the Easy Way</h3>
        <p>
          One feature I particularly love: <strong>Drizzle Kit Studio</strong>.
          With a single command (<code>pnpm run db studio</code>), you fire up a
          web-based UI for your database. Imagine you have a web gallery storing
          loads of images. Instead of manually tweaking SQL or rewriting
          migration scripts to, say, rename a file or adjust a row, you just use
          the GUI. All your database tables appear in the sidebar. Changing a
          field—say, renaming <code>image1.png</code> to{" "}
          <code>hello-world.png</code>—is as simple as editing a cell and
          clicking save. Your backend reflects the change instantly. Efficiency
          at its finest. The Chrome extension takes this further, slotting into
          platforms like PlanetScale’s UI for seamless, direct database
          management.
        </p>

        <h3>SQL-Like Syntax, But TypeSafe</h3>
        <p>
          On the coding side? Drizzle makes your queries almost a 1:1 mapping
          with SQL itself, but with all the type safety you’d expect from modern
          TypeScript dev. Example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            db.delete(images).where(eq(images.id, id), eq(images.userId, user));
          </code>

        <p>
          If you’ve ever fumbled with verbose query builders, you’ll appreciate
          how concise and readable this is. Need authentication checks? Need to
          manipulate fields directly? It’s all mapped out in simple, logical
          code. If you haven’t tried Drizzle, honestly—give it a go.

        <h2>Superhuman: The Fastest Email You’ll Ever Use</h2>
        <p>
          Next, I have to talk about something a little intimidating: my email
          client, <strong>Superhuman</strong>. I use it for all my email, and
          I’ve been on board for a year now. It’s explicitly not for everyone.
          At $30/month, it’s an investment, but for power users (and anyone
          spending an hour or more a day in their inbox), it could be
          life-changing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignore the AI hype—they advertise AI features heavily, but I’ve barely
          touched them. For me, Superhuman excels because it’s the{" "}
          <em>fastest</em> email experience. Think “Vim for your email”—hotkeys
          for everything, including navigation (J/K for up/down, if you’re a Vim
          aficionado), powerful auto-reminders, a universal “command bar,”
          templates, and more.
        </p>

        <h3>Hotkey Magic & Smart Interface Tricks</h3>
        <p>
          Here’s a subtle example of their interface genius: we all know{" "}
          <kbd>Command+A</kbd> selects all. In Superhuman, if you hit Command+A
          while focused on a specific message, it selects{" "}
          <em>from that point downward</em>, not the whole page. It’s such an
          intuitive UI evolution, you’ll wonder why no one did it before. When
          composing, you can trigger emojis via <kbd>:</kbd> (colon) and get
          real emoji autocomplete. Sending emails? Use templated snippets—super
          handy for routine replies, regular investor updates, you name it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Downsides? Well, yes, it’s not cheap, and I wouldn’t recommend it for
          casual, “just-checking-on-Spotify-promos” email users. But for
          business, it’s brilliant. If you’re curious, I do have an affiliate
          link that lowers my bill—and maybe yours, too.
        </p>

        <h2>Super Maven: Blazingly-Fast AI for Code Completion</h2>
        <p>
          Still in the realm of productivity magic: <strong>Super Maven</strong>
          . I’ve tried loads of AI code assistant/copilot solutions, but Super
          Maven left me seriously impressed. It integrates right into VS Code,
          analyzes your specific codebase, and trains itself with every change
          you make. Every time you tweak your code, it adapts—learning
          incrementally from the latest changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anecdote: My co-founder recently used Super Maven while refactoring
          console logs. After making a single change, Super Maven predicted and
          offered completions for all similar changes—<em>immediately</em>
          —because it was actively learning from his workflow, not just generic
          web knowledge. Subtle, adaptive, and frighteningly fast.
        </p>
        <h3>Live Demo: It’s Seriously That Fast</h3>
        <p>When you write something like:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>export async function renameImage(...) &#123; ... &#125;</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Super Maven instantly starts filling in arguments, logic, and
          boilerplate as you type—almost always on-point for repetitive,
          codebase-specific work (think Tailwind class manipulation, database
          functions, etc). If you want generic solutions to big, open-ended
          algorithm challenges, it’s less likely to be perfect—but for{" "}
          <em>your</em> workflow, it shines. So much so that I’m actually
          considering an investment and deeper collaboration. Highly recommended
          if you code in VS Code!
        </p>

        <h2>Synology NAS: Your Own Homegrown Cloud</h2>
        <p>
          Next, a curveball: <strong>Synology DiskStation DS1821+</strong>. If
          you’ve never used a NAS (Network Attached Storage), let me paint the
          picture. It’s a big box with bays for hard drives—a “server” that just
          lives on your local network, holding terabytes of your data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was skeptical. Synology is not cheap, it’s closed source, and I
          didn’t know their file system. But one arrived (thanks to Synology for
          shipping it over; full transparency: they saved me about $2K, but I
          happily spent $4K of my own money upgrading it!).
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it’s integrated into every facet of my workflow: from content
          archiving (think: raw video VODs, assets for YouTube) to cross-device
          backups, to seamless syncing with Dropbox and Google Drive using the{" "}
          <strong>Cloud Sync</strong> plugin. Any new file in my Dropbox vault
          automatically appears on the NAS, and vice versa. And thanks to my 10
          Gigabit local network, shuffling giant assets is basically
          instantaneous.
        </p>
        <h3>Not Just Storage: Docker-Ready Home Server</h3>
        <p>
          Here’s the kicker: the Synology OS lets me run full Docker containers.
          Need a quick local test server or even a Minecraft world? Just pick a
          container image and spin it up—it’s all managed via a web GUI in your
          browser. Local, resilient, and flexible. Yes, the Synology hardware
          and big drives are an investment. But, if you need reliable,
          expandable, private storage—and you geek out about
          containerization—it’s worth every penny.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Pretty TypeScript Errors: Error Messages that Don’t Make You Cry
        </h2>
        <p>
          Circular back to dev productivity: I am <em>not</em> a big VS Code
          plugin person. In fact, I keep my extension list ultra-short. So when
          I say <strong>Pretty TypeScript Errors</strong> is a must-have, I mean
          it.
        </p>
        <h3>Readable, Actionable, and Context-Aware</h3>
        <p>
          Let’s be honest: plain TypeScript errors can be dense, cryptic walls
          of text. “No overload matched this call. Gave the following errors…
          etc.” It’s overwhelming. Pretty TypeScript Errors (by Yoav, a pillar
          in the dev community) transposes error output into beautifully
          formatted, understandable tooltips right in your editor. You get links
          directly to relevant TypeScript TV documentation and even a
          translation of your problem to human-readable explanation via
          tserrortranslator (by Matt Pocock).
        </p>
        <p>
          The technical hack behind it? The extension renders error content as
          SVG icons in tooltips, allowing syntax highlighting and layout magic.
          It’s the kind of improvement you instantly miss when it’s gone. Can’t
          praise it enough; grab it on GitHub or find it on the VS Code
          extension marketplace. Everyone needs this.
        </p>

        <h2>Rectangle: Window Management, Mac-Style Minimalism</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes, great productivity isn’t about flashy features—it’s about
          getting out of your way. Enter <strong>Rectangle</strong>: window
          management for Mac that just works. With{" "}
          <kbd>Control + Option + Arrow Keys</kbd>, you can resize or tile any
          window instantly—left, right, bigger, smaller. It’s like taking i3
          Linux-style controls and making them delightfully simple on macOS.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rectangle is open source (though you can support them by buying the
          App Store version). You don’t need to tinker with multi-space desktops
          or exotic setups—just instant tiling where you want it and minimal
          friction between windows. Pair Rectangle with handy Mac hotkeys (
          <kbd>Command + Tab</kbd> for switching apps, <kbd>Command + ~</kbd> to
          swap between windows within the same app) and you’ve got nearly all
          the power of Linux workspaces, with none of the headaches. Highly
          recommended for anyone who wants to control their workspace without
          giving up macOS comfort.
        </p>

        <h2>PostHog: Analytics and Session Replay for Modern Teams</h2>
        <p>
          Here’s another developer-friendly gem: <strong>PostHog</strong>. Full
          disclosure: they’re now a sponsor, but this is <em>not</em> a paid
          endorsement—I started as a fan and power user. PostHog is open source,
          fully self-hostable, and offers product analytics, web analytics, and
          session replay—all out of the box. (I don’t even use all their
          features like feature flags or data warehouses, but those exist if you
          want them.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Why is this such a big deal? Everything’s built on ClickHouse SQL,
          meaning you get crazy-fast, customizable dashboards and event
          insights. Setting up product analytics or tracking conversions in apps
          like Next.js is straightforward and doesn’t require specialized “data
          ops” experience. Want daily active users? Funnel tracking? Custom
          dashboards? All easy—and if PostHog ever disappears, you control your
          own data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some small UI quirks exist; really specific visualizations sometimes
          require you to drop into SQL rather than the drag-and-drop dashboard.
          But the balance between power and approachability wins. Even leaders
          in the React community—like Sebastian, from This Week in React—use
          PostHog (despite only tapping a fraction of the features). That’s a
          good sign.
        </p>

        <h2>ARC: The Browser That Finally Surprises Me</h2>
        <p>
          Last but not least, let’s talk browsers. I do all of this—browsing,
          managing, coding, and more—in <strong>Arc</strong>. I was hesitant at
          first, bouncing off Arc after only a few days to retreat to the
          familiar embrace of Chrome. But then my co-founder went all-in, and I
          took a second look.
        </p>
        <h3>Profiles, Tab Hierarchy, and Sidebar Bliss</h3>
        <p>
          What won me over? Arc lets me create unique profiles for each part of
          my life: work, content creation, live streams, tutorials. Switching is
          lightning-quick (hotkeys everywhere), and their sidebar-centric
          approach to tabs is a revelation. Tabs above a certain line are
          “pinned,” semi-permanent; below, they’re “ephemeral” (they’ll get
          cleared out). Forget traditional bookmarks—they’ve built a new form of
          navigation hierarchy that <em>actually works</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The full-screen sidebar, picture-in-picture video handling, plugin
          management—it all feels thoughtful. And tools like a one-click
          terminal, quick screenshots, and special dev awareness (local sites
          auto-toggle extra options) make daily life easier.
        </p>
        <h3>Bangs, Search Power, and Platform Notes</h3>
        <p>
          Oh, and “bangs.” They’re the killer feature from DuckDuckGo (my search
          engine of choice). When you prepend a search with <code>!gi</code>, it
          jumps to Google Images; <code>!yt</code>, YouTube; and so on. Once you
          use these, it’s hard to tolerate anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          One caveat: Arc is Mac-only for now, with Windows in early access
          (Linux support? Who knows). But if you’re inside the Apple ecosystem,
          Arc is optimized for you.
        </p>

        <h2>And That’s My Everyday Toolbox!</h2>
        <p>
          That’s the short list of tools shaping my daily workflow. Trust
          me—there are more I want to discuss, but that’s a story for another
          time (and your attention span). If you made it all the way here, give
          me a shout in the comments. Are you interested in more deep dives on
          my workflow? Let me know!
        </p>
        <p>Until next time—stay sharp, stay curious. Peace, nerds.</p>
