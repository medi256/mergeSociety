        </h2>

        <p>
          Is there anything more satisfying than discovering a tool that solves
          an annoyance you didn’t even realize you had? For me, that joy is
          singular. Last year I released a video covering some unheard-of (but
          underrated) tools that streamlined my workflow, and, to my delight,
          you all absolutely loved it. The flood of feedback convinced me to dig
          deeper and film a sequel. So, I went back to my arsenal, assembled a
          stack of my current favorites, and got filming. And then, as fate
          would have it, a tidal wave of news intervened—so this one's been
          waiting in my drafts for a bit. My apologies if you, like me, can't
          resist trying out helpful tools for both your developer and
          non-developer routines.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re ready to supercharge your toolkit, you’re in the right
          place. Every tool I mention here is one I use every single day. I hope
          you come to rely on them as much as I do. Now,{" "}
          <strong>let's dive in!</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>Refined GitHub: The Extension You Didn’t Know You Needed</h2>
        <p>
          Let's start with a game-changer for anyone living inside GitHub:{" "}
          <strong>Refined GitHub</strong>. This browser extension tackles
          countless everyday frustrations in GitHub's interface—so well, in
          fact, that I was shocked I hadn’t tried it sooner. (Don't worry, it’s
          starred now!)
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes it special? It’s all about tiny, cumulative improvements
          that completely shift your workflow:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Issue & PR Colors by Recency:</strong> See at a glance
            what’s fresh and what’s old, by color-coding updates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Default Pull Request Sorting:</strong> For busy repositories
            (like my own project <strong>Quick Pick</strong>, which caused quite
            a stir), it changes the default sort of pull requests to “most
            recently updated” instead of “most recently opened.”{" "}
            <strong>This should be the standard!</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Clear Status Indicators:</strong> It shouts (in big letters)
            when you’ve requested changes and when a PR was last updated. In
            busy, multi-contributor projects, this polished interface cuts your
            time spent sorting out merge chaos by orders of magnitude.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you've felt the pain of managing mountains of pull requests,
          Refined GitHub is your new best friend.{" "}
          <strong>Give it a go—you'll instantly see the difference.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>T3 Chat: Your New AI Companion (and a Quick Sponsor Shout)</h2>
        <p>
          If you've watched any of my videos, you might recognize my favorite AI
          assistant, <strong>T3 Chat</strong>. But here’s the real story: I
          built it because every other AI chat app out there frustrated me
          endlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since launching T3 Chat, tens of thousands use it daily and swear they
          can’t go back to the alternatives (which, frankly, are a drag to use).
          So, why do people love it? Here’s a whirlwind tour:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Model Picker:</strong> Choose literally any modern model
            (yes, all of them) with a click. No weird restrictions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Image Generation:</strong> It works! You get 100 OpenAI
            image generations a month—no hoops to jump through.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Generous Free Tier:</strong> 1,500 messages/month to most
            models; stick to lightweight ones like Gemini 2.5 Flash, and you
            might never need to pay.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Affordable Premium:</strong> Want it all? $8/month unlocks{" "}
            <em>everything</em>. Trust me, I’m not trying to bankrupt us, but it
            really is the best deal in AI tools, period.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Pro tip: For new users, use code <strong>Cool-Tools</strong> at

          Excalidraw: Diagramming, Whiteboarding, and the End of Penmanship
          Nightmares
        </h2>
        <p>
          Next up is the tool that single-handedly changed my approach to
          communicating ideas: <strong>Excalidraw</strong>. If you’ve ever been
          haunted by bad handwriting (like I was—nearly held back in elementary
          school over it!), you know the existential terror of whiteboarding in
          job interviews or team meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excalidraw eliminated those anxieties for me. Imagine digital
          whiteboarding where <em>your handwriting no longer matters</em>, and
          diagramming is as quick as your thoughts. This wasn’t just a personal
          win; it changed workplace culture around me. At Twitch, everyone
          started diagramming ideas, not just talking about them. My friends, my
          streams, my viewers—Excalidraw became my primary language, and some of
          my top videos are basically me “Excalidrawing” my thoughts for the
          world to see.
        </p>
        <p>Why is Excalidraw so indispensable?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Open Source:</strong> You can embed canvases into your own
            apps, play with its code, and customize it endlessly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pro Features:</strong> For about $5/month, you get multiple
            canvases, team collaboration, and more—plus you’re directly
            supporting the creators.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Light & Dark Mode:</strong> Whether you prefer crisp
            whiteboards or need to save your retinas (like most of my fans),
            it’s all here—one toggle away.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I genuinely don’t know if I’d have become a content creator without
          Excalidraw. If you think visually but despise pen-and-paper,{" "}
          <strong>download it immediately</strong>.

        <h2>Bruno & Yak: The New (Open Source) Standouts for API Testing</h2>
        <p>
          If you’re still mourning the decline of Insomnia (the once-beloved
          open source API tool, now crumbling since its acquisition), don’t
          despair. <strong>Bruno</strong> is here, rising fast as the open
          alternative everyone’s talking about.
        </p>
        <p>Why do I rely on Bruno?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Seamless API Testing:</strong> Point it at your project’s
            folder. Instantly replay events and interrogate endpoints, all with
            a UI that’s refreshingly clean.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Git Integration:</strong> Keep API schemas and test cases
            version-controlled—workflows feel modern and lightweight compared to
            Postman.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No Postman Quirks:</strong> Bruno steers clear of all that
            variable-management weirdness that's made Postman a headache for so
            many.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          And thanks to my live chat, I’ve learned about <strong>Yak</strong>:
          crafted by the original developer of Insomnia. It’s open source, still
          in heavy development, and beloved by early adopters. I haven’t tried
          Yak myself yet, but if you’re looking to stay on the cutting-edge of
          API tooling, check it out.

        <h2>Raycast: Reimagining Productivity on Mac (and a Bit More)</h2>
        <p>
          Spotlight fans, brace yourselves. If you love Mac’s built-in
          command-space launcher, <strong>Raycast</strong> is a jaw-dropping
          upgrade. I literally rebound my Spotlight hotkey to launch Raycast,
          and at this point, I don’t think I could survive otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>It’s got everything:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Lightning Math:</strong> Built-in calculator lets you punch
            in equations, hit enter, and—bam—the result is copied to your
            clipboard. With a handy history, no less.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>App Switching:</strong> Assign hotkeys (like Ctrl+1, 2, 3)
            to instantly pop between your favorite apps (browser, editor,
            terminal).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Raycast is free (there’s a pro version with extra goodies) and the
          productivity boost is immense. Whether you use it for quick
          calculations, launching apps, or anything else, it’s an essential Mac
          companion.
        </p>

        <h2>
          SVGL: The Secret SVG Utility for Creators (Especially via Raycast)
        </h2>
        <p>
          Quick tangent: If you ever need to grab SVG assets for development or
          design—say, for YouTube thumbnails or quick mockups—
          <strong>SVGL</strong> is the holy grail. Built by Pablo and open
          sourced for the community, it delivers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Lightning-Fast SVG Copy:</strong> Search (for example, the
            Typescript or Bluesky logo), hit enter, instantly copy—that logo’s
            now on your clipboard.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Raycast Integration:</strong> Type “svg” in Raycast, hit
            search, and copy logos in seconds. No more endless Google image
            searches or wonky drag-and-drop from browser windows.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For making high-quality thumbnails, presentations, or app mockups,
          SVGL has saved me hours, easily. A massive thank you to Pablo (and
          supporting contributors) for bringing this tool to life.

        <h2>OrbStack: Docker, But Actually Bearable on Mac</h2>
        <p>
          Docker Desktop’s ARM transition was, frankly, painful. So if you’re
          hunting for a less bloated, much faster alternative for managing
          Docker containers on Mac—make <strong>OrbStack</strong> your new
          default.
        </p>
        <p>
          Launching containers is instant. The interface? A breath of fresh air.
          No more sluggish launches or battery-draining bloat. Plus, if you need
          extras (like spinning up an Olama web UI for local AI models),
          OrbStack makes it nearly effortless.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s <strong>free for personal use</strong>, and for commercial devs,
          the paid tier is well worth it.

        <h2>
          Legcord (formerly ArmCord): A Discord Client That Actually Works for
          Mac
        </h2>
        <p>
          Here’s a weird one: For years, there was no proper ARM-native Discord
          client for Mac. Instead, the official app ran through Rosetta
          emulation, meaning poor performance and wasted battery.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s where Legcord (originally called ArmCord) came in—a minimal,
          Electron-based Discord app that eventually gained all the native
          features you’d expect. Its backstory is wild: they got DMCA’d by ARM
          Holdings for the name, so it was reborn (with a leg up, pun intended)
          as Legcord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Performance is superb, updates are less intrusive, and resource usage
          is way down. If Discord is central to your work or social life on Mac,
          make the switch. You’ll wonder how you ever dealt with the original
          client.
        </p>

        <h2>Cursor: The AI-Powered Editor I Now Swear By</h2>
        <p>
          Let me say this as plainly as possible: <strong>Cursor</strong> is my
          go-to code editor. Yes, it’s a fork of VS Code, but it’s so much
          smarter and more productive—especially if you’re constantly switching
          between languages, frameworks, or projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: On my <strong>One App, Five Stacks</strong> project (building
          the same app across different stacks), I’d write code in the Phoenix
          (Elixir) version, then use Cursor’s <em>Composer</em> to instantly
          adapt it for the Rails version. I’d ask it questions, request
          rewrites—the editor just handled things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Combined with Claude (the AI model), Cursor is the best productivity
          investment I’ve made in ages. If you’re skeptical, I was too! (I
          churned twice before falling in love.) So give it a whirl—my
          endorsement isn’t given lightly.
        </p>

        <h2>Minimal Theme for Twitter: Social Media, Sans Clutter</h2>
        <p>
          Last but absolutely not least: Twitter’s interface, but cleansed. The{" "}
          <strong>Minimal Theme</strong> Chrome extension, by{" "}
          <strong>Typefully</strong> (the amazing folks behind a Twitter drafts
          manager and analytics suite), strips away ads, collapses annoying
          sidebars, and just generally makes Twitter usable again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Replies are more readable. Sidebars stay out of the way (unless you
          hover, though sometimes the hover detection, admittedly, is finicky).
          And yes, there’s a bug: in certain screen resolutions, navigation
          buttons break. My wish to Typefully: please fix it! I’ve poked at the
          code myself, but it’s a beast to wrangle. Still, the productivity
          boost (and cleaner mental energy) this extension brings is worth the
          occasional hiccup.

          focusing solely on CLI power-tools. Got favorite terminal utilities?
