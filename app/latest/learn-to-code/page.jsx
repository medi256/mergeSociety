        </h2>
        <p>
          For over a decade, “Learn to Code” dominated American education and
          career advice, sparking a computer science gold rush at elite
          universities and fueling a bootcamp bonanza. Yet, as the dust settles,
          troubling trends emerge: layoffs, degree inflation, overwhelmed
          students, and fewer actual jobs. What sparked this boom in computer
          science, why did it spiral out of control, and what does this teach us
          about the future of tech careers—and the myths we tell ourselves?
        </p>

        <h2>
          The 1,000% Surge: Computer Science Mania at America's Top Universities
        </h2>
        <p>
          Picture this: between 2011 and 2021, UC Berkeley witnessed a
          staggering 1,106% increase in computer science graduates. At this
          breakneck pace, one CS professor estimated that all 30,000 Berkeley
          undergraduates could be coding away within just seven years. If you
          extend this out far enough, by 2059 the institution could
          theoretically be producing more computer scientists than there are
          people in California.
        </p>
        <p>
          Berkeley isn’t even the reigning champion of coding obsession. Take a
          tour around American academia and you’ll find even more dramatic
          numbers. At MIT—home to the birth of radar, spreadsheet software, and
          the lithium-ion battery—nearly{" "}
          <strong>40% of all undergraduates major in computer science</strong>.
          For context, just <strong>seven</strong> students graduated with a
          Bachelor of Science in Chemistry last year. In contrast,{" "}
          <strong>266</strong> graduated in computer science and engineering,
          and more than <strong>twice as many</strong> completed the broader
          electrical engineering and computer science major.
        </p>
        <p>
          The upshot? In just 15 years, American colleges shifted from offering
          a smorgasbord of majors to becoming Microsoft and Google training
          grounds, squeezing in a little philosophy and physics on the side. In
          2023, Berkeley followed the lead of MIT and Cornell by launching a
          dedicated College of Computing—their first new school since Dwight
          Eisenhower was in the White House.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Silicon Valley Dreams: How Coding Became America’s “Golden Ticket”
        </h2>
        <p>
          How did we get here? The roots go back to the cultural and economic
          wave triggered by the launch of the iPhone in 2007, soon followed by
          tech juggernauts like Uber, Airbnb, and Instagram. Suddenly, Silicon
          Valley’s garages replaced Wall Street boardrooms as the nation’s power
          centers. TV and cinema, with hits like <em>The Social Network</em> and{" "}
          <em>Silicon Valley</em>, mythologized the tech founder, casting them
          as the 21st century’s answer to yesterday’s industrial tycoons: more
          meritocratic, more visionary, definitely more eccentric.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, the nation’s leaders <em>officially</em> declared coding the
          career path of the future. President Obama hailed coding as a ticket
          to the middle class, launched Computer Science Education Week, and
          promoted “Hour of Code.” Warnings of a coming "shortfall of 1 million
          STEM graduates by 2022" became gospel. Even New York Mayor Michael
          Bloomberg famously pledged in 2012 to learn to code himself—though,
          for the record, nobody has evidence that he actually did.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Learn to code,” the era’s mantra, offered something for everyone:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Republicans saw it as practical, vocational education.</li>
          <li>Corporations glimpsed a pipeline of cheap, pre-trained labor.</li>
          <li>
            National security hawks rallied behind its potential to keep America
            globally competitive.
          </li>
          <li>
            Diversity advocates pitched it as a way to expand opportunity.
          </li>
          <li>
            For Democrats engineering the post-recession recovery, it sounded
            hopeful and conveniently vague—ready to absorb complex questions
            about globalization and job losses.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The media echoed: “Learn to code.” Suddenly, computer science classes
          were as common as calculus—offered in nearly 15,000 high schools and
          37% of all middle schools. Eleven states now <strong>require</strong>{" "}
          every student to take a CS class to graduate.

          So persuasive was this narrative that few questioned it. Media
          profiles declared “anyone can become a computer scientist with a
          little hard work.” President Biden put it bluntly: “Anybody who can
          throw coal into a furnace can learn how to program, for God’s sake.”
          One 2012 article, published while U.S. unemployment soared above 8%,
          promised anxious job seekers not just a new job, but a <em>fun</em>{" "}
          one—“more like architecture than mathematics.”
        </p>
        <p>
          No wonder an entire generation—older Gen Z, younger
          millennials—flocked to CS degrees and coding bootcamps, especially
          after watching their siblings struggle through the Great Recession.
          The siren song was irresistible: six-figure jobs! Hoodies instead of
          suits! The freedom to work from a beanbag rather than a cubicle.

          Colleges and Bootcamps Buckle: The Cracks Beneath the Coding Boom
        </h2>
        <p>
          Yet, for all of Big Tech’s readiness to soak up new talent, America’s
          universities were blindsided. Fads in college majors are nothing
          new—law schools booming after TV dramas, pharmacy’s spike amid a
          pharmacist shortage—but nothing matched the scale or speed of the CS
          explosion. Within a decade, undergraduate enrollments{" "}
          <strong>tripled</strong>. But the number of new PhDs—needed to teach
          the rapidly swelling undergraduate classes—remained flat. Why? Put
          simply, the money wasn’t there: a CS PhD student could fetch $40,000 a
          year, maybe, compared to $200,000 or more at Amazon or Netflix.
        </p>
        <p>
          The outcome: impersonal, factory-like department cultures. Professors
          stretched past their limits, classes ballooning to 400, even 600
          students. Peer teaching exploded; the only person you could turn to
          might be another undergrad who'd just survived the same grind last
          semester. Some universities, desperate to control the flood, made
          applicants re-apply to CS programs mid-degree, or, like at Swarthmore,
          University of Maryland, and UCSD, used pure lottery systems—paying
          over $90,000 in tuition, only to be denied, by the roll of electronic
          dice, your preferred major.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result? Many students graduated disillusioned and in debt, with
          scant career support, minimal faculty interaction, and often only a
          shallow grasp of practical programming. Most programs focused on
          foundational algorithms and theoretical constructs, spread across a
          dozen languages but mastering none—hardly ideal for landing a modern
          tech job hungry for specific frameworks and hands-on skills.
        </p>

        <h2>Bootcamp Hype and Reality: A Short-Cut With Hidden Costs</h2>
        <p>
          Predictably, Silicon Valley’s disruptors sniffed an opportunity. Why
          wade through four years of general education when bootcamps, for
          $10,000 to $30,000, could promise a six-figure salary after just
          twelve weeks? Bootcamps pitched themselves with the promise of “tech
          interview prep,” churning out grads at half the rate of four-year CS
          programs and vacuuming up over $200 million per year at their peak.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as their numbers swelled, bootcamps confronted painful realities.
          First, student reputations became a double-edged sword—if a graduate
          floundered or got fired, it hurt future alumni job prospects. Only the
          best applicants were accepted, with some bootcamps boasting
          Harvard-level selectivity (Hack Reactor’s acceptance rate? Just 3%).
          Teacher shortages loomed, salaries couldn’t match industry,
          and—mirroring academia—bootcamps hired their own recent grads, further
          inflating employment statistics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prices rose. Desperate for funding, they eyed federally-backed student
          loans but, lacking accreditation, couldn’t qualify—until a Department
          of Education loophole in 2011. Through partnerships with universities
          and “online program managers” (OPMs), bootcamps could court students
          under prestigious academic brands, take a 40% revenue cut, and gain
          access to government financial aid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ironically, in their rush to disrupt academia, bootcamps became just
          as bureaucratic and unwieldy as the colleges they aimed to
          replace—and, eventually, were absorbed by the very universities they
          sought to out-innovate.
        </p>

        <h2>The Crash: Tech Layoffs and the Limits of “Learn to Code”</h2>
        <p>
          All of this seemed to "work" while tech growth soared, but as the
          pandemic waned and the industry cooled, the bubble burst. In 2023,
          nearly half a million tech workers lost their jobs. In both 2022 and
          again in 2024, another quarter-million layoffs followed. That’s as
          many jobs as vanished in America’s much-lamented China manufacturing
          shock.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, tech’s unemployment rate outpaced the national average. New
          graduates had offers canceled. Professors at elite programs like
          Berkeley reported that even their best students struggled to find
          jobs. Bootcamps fared worse: 2U filed for bankruptcy, Launch Academy
          “paused” enrollment, and Dev Bootcamp (acquired by Kaplan) shuttered
          for good.
        </p>
        <p>
          For perspective, the U.S. has{" "}
          <strong>
            fewer software developers employed today than it did six years ago
          </strong>
          . We were warned there would be a shortfall of a million STEM
          jobs—somehow, we got the opposite. What happened? The answer isn’t
          complicated: supply and demand. UC Berkeley’s 1,000% growth couldn’t
          have been sustainable. “Learn to code” didn’t cause the tech downturn
          (interest rates and investment trends played a huge part), but it did
          flood the market, making programmers more dispensable, easier to hire
          and fire in cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts 11% growth for the sector by
          2033, but that’s cold comfort to the “starry-eyed” students who bought
          into the limitless promise of tech. “Learn to code” became an article
          of faith—an all-purpose solution, unmoored from economic reality.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Coding Is Not Reading or Writing: The Dangerous Myth of Universality
        </h2>
        <p>
          At its peak, “Learn to code” was presented as the new literacy. Some
          thought every American, from teachers to electricians to nurses, would
          soon be programming daily. That premise, if accepted, made a 1,000%
          surge in CS grads seem logical. But tech remains a niche career—only
          about 2.3% of the U.S. workforce even with generous estimates—far less
          than the 7 million unemployed “Learn to code” was supposed to save.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in a world building ever-smarter AI and endless apps, someone
          still has to manufacture keyboards, fix broadband, and manage all the
          offline infrastructure that digital transformation overlooks. Worse,
          tech is volatile—AI today, some new disruption tomorrow. This
          generation’s endless tech boom was an anomaly, not a guarantee.
        </p>

        <h2>Real Skills, Real People: Coding Isn’t for Everyone</h2>
        <p>
          Beyond economics, “Learn to code” ignored a simple truth: human
          variety. Some people thrive at complex problem-solving under
          pressure—many simply don’t, or don’t want to. Not everyone wants to
          sit in front of a monitor, or collaborate on Scrum boards, or hack
          away into the night. If you swapped in any other job—welding, nursing,
          epidemiology—the absurdity becomes clear. The soundbite was seductive,
          but in practice exploitative: it boiled everyone down to
          interchangeable labor, promising that anyone—from a single parent
          working two jobs, to a layoff survivor, to a privileged
          18-year-old—could emerge as a six-figure developer after 12 weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reality was much harsher. Single parents found no support for their
          needs in high-intensity bootcamps. Contractors and other
          career-changers were told coding was “so easy” only to struggle,
          internalizing blame for not catching up with classmates who already
          had a head start. Many graduates found only a $20,000 debt, lost
          wages, and a resume line that—far from impressing future
          employers—worked against them. Some did find success, only to be laid
          off in the next contraction, disposable regardless of their effort or
          credentials.
        </p>

        <h2>What Actually Matters: Adaptability, Not Trends</h2>
        <p>
          “Learn to code” was never a magic fix for economic insecurity. Just as
          “learn to service wind turbines” or “learn occupational
          therapy”—fields projected to grow much faster than software—coding is
          simply one of many good careers. Labor markets are fickle; everyone is
          subject to their tides. The best strategy? Diversify your skills,
          emphasize adaptability, and invest in timeless abilities like
          problem-solving and creative thinking.
