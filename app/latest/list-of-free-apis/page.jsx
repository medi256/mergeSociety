        <p>
          If you're hunting for free APIs, I'm walking you through the exact 40
          I actually use and test in real projects so you can plug them into
          your app today without blowing your budget.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            These free APIs cover images, video, games, news, finance, weather,
            maps, PDFs, email, speech to text, and even anime frame search, with
            generous free tiers that are perfect for prototypes and small apps.
            You can query high quality stock photos, AB test YouTube thumbnails,
            stash JSON without spinning up a database, grab company logos, and
            wire up webhooks without managing servers. A few are truly no key
            required, some have daily or monthly quotas, and a couple have
            pricing that jumps fast, so I call that out so you do not get
            surprised. If you want to build something this weekend, you can mix
            and match these and ship a real feature in a few hours.

        <section>
          <h2>Free Image, Video, and What-To-Watch APIs To Kick Things Off</h2>

          <h3>
            Unsplash API - high quality stock photos that do not look stocky
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Unsplash API gives you free access to a huge library of
            beautiful, high resolution photos that do not have that awkward
            staged vibe. Think real textures, real places, real people.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can write a quick function to query images for your blog post by
            keyword, then show a tasteful banner without buying a license. Or
            wire it into your group chat bot to pull a relevant image when
            someone mentions a topic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Search by term, orientation, color, or even collections. Then save
            the URLs or download links and render responsive images in your UI.
            Fast, clean, and it makes any project look more professional.
          </p>

          <h3>
            YouTube Data API - experiment with your own channel like a product
          </h3>
          <p>
            If you want to treat your YouTube channel like a lab, the YouTube
            API lets you change thumbnails and titles programmatically. That
            means practical AB testing in code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Switch two thumbnail variants for a set window, measure click
            through rate, then automatically set the winner. You can also adjust
            titles dynamically based on seasonality or trends.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is surprisingly fun to automate small creative tweaks, and you
            will learn fast what actually earns clicks for your audience.
          </p>

          <h3>What-to-watch search engine - build your own streaming picker</h3>
          <p>
            The classic modern day predicament: where on earth is Family Guy -
            Netflix, Disney Plus, Paramount Plus, lootube. I love this one
            because it works like a search engine based on movies or shows you
            give it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feed it a title and get back where to watch, by service and region,
            then display those options in your app. Perfect for a weekend
            project that helps your group decide what to put on without constant
            debate.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is simple to integrate, and even a basic results page with
            streaming links feels insanely useful in real life.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>
            Lightweight Databases, Logos, Anime, and Game Data Without Headaches
          </h2>

          <h3>Pantry - a tiny database so you do not spin up a real one</h3>
          <p>
            Pricing is wild on most managed databases, and a lot of small apps
            do not need a full server. Pantry gives you 1,000 requests per month
            and 100 megabytes of JSON storage with a built in CRUD interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is basically tinydb vibes for Python, but as a service with
            simple HTTP calls. Perfect for settings, user preferences, short
            term caches, or MVPs where spinning up Postgres is overkill.
          </p>
          <p>Oh, and it is Canadian too. Had to smile at that.</p>

          <h3>Clearbit Logo API - grab company logos in one request</h3>
          <p>
            Hyper niche, but when you need it, you need it. Clearbit lets you
            fetch company logos by domain with a single HTTP request.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drop in twitter.com and you get Twitter’s logo back in a clean
            format. It is ideal for dashboards, link previews, or B2B tools
            where that single logo adds instant polish.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is the classic 2 percent detail that makes a UI feel like a 10
            out of 10.
          </p>

          <h3>Waifu API - build your anime wife for free</h3>
          <p>
            Again, if you care about this, you care about this. The Waifu API
            lets you fetch anime character images free, and my favorite endpoint
            is ufi.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I need to submit a pull request and look like I actually
            program, I can run content through that endpoint and I am good to
            go. It is nerdy, it is weird, it is fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use it to add playful flair to community apps or as a reward image
            in a Discord bot mini game.
          </p>

          <h3>IGDB - the Internet Game Database owned by Twitch</h3>
          <p>
            Gamers, this one goes deep. IGDB has a free API with intense detail,
            and it is owned by Twitch, which makes sense given how tied Twitch
            is to the gaming world.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can query game versions, genres, covers, screenshots, platforms,
            even age ratings. If you are building anything around discovery or
            collections, it is a gold mine.
          </p>
          <p>
            My favorite Discord channel built a cool app on IGDB data. It is
            free, so why not try it for your build too.
          </p>

          <h3>Discord API - build custom bots that genuinely engage people</h3>
          <p>
            The Discord API is perfect for custom bots that play games, level
            people up, or automate moderation. On my Discord, we run OG roid and
            it basically does everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a great way to keep your community active with quests, roles,
            or scoreboards. MidJourney uses Discord for its entire UX, and there
            are SDKs for almost every programming language.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have an idea for a community feature, the Discord API
            probably supports it.
          </p>

          <aside>
            <p>
              <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When you are testing a bot, spin up a
              private server and a test channel so you can break things freely.
              Log everything to a dedicated debug channel and delete every hour.
            </p>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>
            News, Fake Data, Forex, Webhooks, Diagrams, Docs, Dogs, and a Panda
            That Geocodes
          </h2>

          <h3>World News API - fresh headlines, but go easy on the quota</h3>
          <p>
            Want up to date world news in your app? This API has a free tier,
            but it needs to chill out a bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            You get 50 points per day and then you are out of calls. Prices jump
            fast, so make sure you are actually making money before you lean on
            it in production.
          </p>
          <p>
            Great for prototypes, dashboards, or a small daily digest feature
            for your users.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Random Data Generator - fake people, addresses, products without a
            key
          </h3>
          <p>
            When you test an app, you need a mess of fake data so you can see
            real lists and forms react to input. Random Data Generator does not
            require an API key and can emit a lot of different models.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is probably running on top of Faker.js, but if you just want to
            hit an endpoint and get JSON, this is perfect. You can seed your
            local database, fixture your tests, or populate staging with safe
            fake content.
          </p>

          <h3>Foreign exchange rates - free, no auth, and historical data</h3>
          <p>
            FX is annoying until it is not, and then you are grateful you wired
            it in early. This API does not require an auth key, and if you grab
            the free tier you also get historical rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any app that touches payments or multicurrency tags needs rates
            somewhere in the flow. This one is free and fair, which is rare in
            finance data.
          </p>

          <h3>Svix - webhooks as a service</h3>
          <p>
            When your app does something and needs to notify another app, you
            use webhooks. Svix gives you webhooks as a service so you do not
            have to roll your own delivery and retries.
          </p>
          <p>
            You do need to sign up, but it is free and has SDKs for basically
            every language. It is a clean way to connect systems without
            managing a queue yourself.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Kroki-style diagrams from text - turn plain text into PNG or JPEG
          </h3>
          <p>
            Croaky lets you send text and get back a diagram as a PNG or JPEG.
            Think database schemas, sequence diagrams, or flowcharts generated
            on the fly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The database example is handy, but there are tons of other diagram
            types you can use in docs, blog posts, or your app’s product tours.
            It is a neat way to convert text models into visuals your users can
            follow.
          </p>

          <h3>Thanks Exoscale for two servers</h3>
          <p>
            Sounds funny, only two servers, but I appreciate the support. Little
            boosts like this keep experiments online while I hammer away at
            ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes that is all you need to validate a small service or cron
            worker before you scale or shut it down.
          </p>

          <h3>Google Docs API - yes, you can connect your docs to code</h3>
          <p>
            You can connect to Google Docs with an API. Pull your doc content as
            JSON, build side panel add ons, or connect Docs to other services
            through your own middleware.
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagine a button in Docs that syncs a draft to your CMS with labels,
            or merges comments into your issue tracker. Google Dogs who knew.
            Could not resist.
          </p>

          <h3>
            HTTP Status Dogs - the least boring status codes on the internet
          </h3>
          <p>
            Status codes are boring, but HTTP status dogs are not. I love the
            403 Forbidden pup, and you can fetch any status by code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use it to teach beginners, lighten up error pages, or add a smile to
            a devtools overlay. I would be kind of annoyed if those images took
            forever to load though, so cache them.
          </p>

          <h3>Geokio - the cute panda that geocodes</h3>
          <p>
            This cute panda is the face of geocoding places. When someone enters
            an address as text, you need to translate that into latitude and
            longitude for Google Maps or your map library.
          </p>
          <p>
            Google Maps can do it, for a big dollar. Geokio gives you 2,500 free
            API requests daily, which is a lot for a small app or a test
            environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are prototyping delivery zones, radius alerts, or store
            locators, this free tier will carry you a long way.

          <h2>Building Faster With AI Inside Your Editor</h2>

          <h3>
            Machine + GPT 4 in JetBrains - real coding help with real context
          </h3>
          <p>
            I built a lot of these examples using AI with Machine, which is the
            sponsor of this video. Right now GPT 4 is by far the best large
            language model for code.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the Machine extension in JetBrains, it indexes my whole project
            and embeds it so I can ask specific questions without pasting files
            into a prompt window. It understands the codebase, not just the
            single file I am staring at.
          </p>
          <p>
            It has a 32k context length, so I can dump huge chunks of
            documentation in and keep building without leaving the editor. That
            is key when you are integrating new APIs at speed.
          </p>

          <h3>Practical flow - ask, integrate, ship</h3>
          <p>
            Because this article is full of API projects, I will grab the Geokio
            API docs, toss the reference into Machine, and ask it to stub a
            simple app. Then I connect the generated code to what I already
            have.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have used JetBrains my entire life, so putting GPT 4 right into
            that editor is a no brainer. Less window switching, more small wins
            stacked up fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks Machine for sponsoring the build sprint and making the flow
            smoother.
          </p>

          <aside>
            <p>
              <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Keep a docs folder in your repo for any
              API you integrate. Paste the key endpoints and examples there so
              your AI assistant can reason over it, and leave notes about quotas
              and gotchas for future you.

          <h2>
            Tickets, PDFs, File Conversion, Local LLMs, Dictionary, Weather, and
            Finance Data
          </h2>

          <h3>Ticketmaster API - event discovery from the source</h3>
          <p>
            Ticketmaster has an API. Wild, right. Since Ticketmaster basically
            has a monopoly on everything live, this API is great for searching
            events for discovery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Basically, what you can view in the app you can do here. Not the
            most flexible thing in the world, but if you want city filters or
            category listings, it is useful.
          </p>

          <h3>ILovePDF - the tool that fixes the PDFs I do not love</h3>
          <p>
            The irony behind I Love PDF is that I hate PDFs. With a burning
            fiery passion. But ILovePDF makes it easy to extract text, edit
            PDFs, remove passwords, compress, and a lot more.
          </p>
          <p>
            They have libraries in Ruby, Node, and PHP, but plain REST calls are
            usually good enough. If your users upload documents, you probably
            need at least two of these actions.
          </p>

          <h3>CloudConvert - convert files without building a pipeline</h3>
          <p>
            I tried so hard to find a simple API to convert files reliably and
            CloudConvert is the best one I found. Cloud Covert, CloudConvert,
            you know the one.
          </p>
          <p>
            You get 25 conversions on the free tier. That is it folks. If file
            conversion is a core feature, this is still the cheapest way to get
            it done right.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if you only ever convert between two very specific types,
            automate it with Python locally and save the quota for users who
            really need it.
          </p>

          <h3>Ollama - run LLMs locally with a simple API</h3>
          <p>
            Ollama lets you run large language models on your machine and
            exposes a local API on localhost. Models like Llama 2, Mistral, or
            LLaVA are all available.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are building privacy centric apps and still want AI features,
            this is awesome and free. Your data stays on your box, and you still
            get completion and embedding style endpoints.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is shockingly good for prototyping AI features without cloud
            costs.
          </p>

          <h3>Free Dictionary API - define words without a login</h3>
          <p>
            The Free Dictionary API is exactly what it sounds like. No API key
            required, and it is run off donations, so props to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Build a browser extension that lets you highlight a word and get a
            clean definition. That way you do not get roasted in your group chat
            for asking what a word means.
          </p>

          <h3>OpenWeather - the weather data workhorse</h3>
          <p>
            Hey look, the API we all used when we learned Python, Java, or
            React, and it is buried this far into the list. Jokes aside,
            OpenWeather is goated.
          </p>
          <p>
            You get 1,000 API calls free per day, and it is reliable. Weather
            data can feel boring, but you can do fun things like connecting it
            to AI to suggest what to wear or when to run errands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use it at your discretion. Or do a little Easter egg on your site
            that changes theme based on rain.
          </p>

          <h3>Core trading data API - build a bot with fundamentals</h3>
          <p>
            If you want to build a trading bot like I did, this is the API I
            used for a lot of the core functions. All the technical terms like P
            E ratio and more are there, plus historical data.
          </p>
          <p>
            You get 25 requests per day, which is okay for testing strategies
            and caching results. It even has data on wheat, corn, and cotton, in
            case the Amish start writing trading algos.
          </p>
          <p>Did I open source that yet. I should check.</p>

          <h3>Yahoo Finance via yfinance - the lifeline of Yahoo</h3>
          <p>
            Yahoo Finance is the only thing keeping Yahoo alive. I am convinced.
            As for an official API, it is weird. I do not even know if they have
            a proper one.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the yfinance package in Python reliably, well most of the time,
            fetches historical stock data. It seems like a nightmare to
            maintain, so props to the maintainer keeping it steady.

            Anime, Favorite Apps, Trading, Space, Movies, Dates, and Planes
          </h2>

          <h3>Deck of Cards API - simple concept, delightful execution</h3>
          <p>
            The Deck of Cards API is hilarious because cards are not that
            complex. But if you are making a game or a card based UI, it is
            perfect.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can draw two cards from an endpoint and it just feels right.
            There are piles, shuffling decks, shuffling piles, listing cards in
            piles. Okay, maybe it is a bit complex after all.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also cute. That matters when you are building something
            playful.
          </p>

          <h3>WordPress REST API - headless without the pain</h3>
          <p>
            I used to work with WordPress and never realized this was this good.
            It has a REST API you can query directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to start a site for a client or yourself, but also want
            to do the fancy TypeScript, React, Astro front end, this is a great
            way to do it. Honestly, without the plugin mess, WordPress is pretty
            great.
          </p>
          <p>I said it. I said it. I said it again.</p>

          <h3>Spotify API - your music history as a feature</h3>
          <p>
            Spotify’s API is popular for a reason. You can retrieve artists,
            songs, and yes, the pennies they pay artists every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spin up a serverless function that grabs your latest listened song
            every 30 minutes and shows it on your website. It is a tiny window
            into your taste that users love.
          </p>

          <h3>Podcast Index - metadata and transcripts that unlock ideas</h3>
          <p>
            Podcast Index lets you grab information on podcasts, and the part I
            care about most is the transcript. It gives you a downloadable URL
            and the transcript is time coded.
          </p>
          <p>
            That means you can do cool AI things like highlight specific
            moments, build topic maps, or make those annoying videos with one
            word at a time popping up on screen. The data is there if you want
            to play.
          </p>

          <h3>Deepgram - speech to text with extras</h3>
          <p>
            Deepgram is a speech to text AI like OpenAI’s Whisper, but with
            extra features. You can get timestamps for each word, summarize
            audio, and even sentiment analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            You do need to sign up and get a key, but no credit card and you get
            200 credits. That is more than enough to build a working demo.
          </p>
          <p>
            I built a project where it sped up certain podcast hosts and slowed
            down others. It was hilarious and surprisingly listenable.
          </p>

          <h3>ZenQuotes - one call, instant inspiration</h3>
          <p>
            ZenQuotes is probably the one you used in a tutorial. You do not
            need a key and it is perfect for trying out a new programming
            language or dropping a silly Easter egg into your Discord bot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Call the API, get the quote, display it. Beyond simple, and fun to
            style.
          </p>

          <h3>Open Food Facts - scan a barcode, get the truth</h3>
          <p>
            Open Food Facts is awesome. Enter a barcode number and it returns
            the full product details for that exact item.
          </p>
          <p>
            I built an app last week where I rebuilt a full flow from scratch
            and saved the result to a database with a nutritional score. It felt
            like a cheat code to have all that data so easily.
          </p>

          <h3>Stripe - the way to accept payments without pain</h3>
          <p>
            Stripe’s API is revolutionary. I do not have to do the hard sell
            here.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is easy to get started and accept payments whether you are
            building a store or a financial automation tool. It is not free, it
            is 2.9 percent plus 30 cents per transaction, but the developer
            experience is worth it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want truly free, you could try crypto, but you will probably
            lose money there in other ways.
          </p>

          <h3>Resend - sending emails without the ancient pain</h3>
          <p>
            Resend makes sending emails extremely easy. You should have seen the
            hacks I built to get email working before this.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a simple integration in basically any language, plus you can
            create email templates using React. And yes, email still uses HTML
            tables. We suffer together.
          </p>
          <p>
            One last thing though. They called their reliable email
            infrastructure Resend. Am I the only one raising an eyebrow.
          </p>

          <h3>trace.moe - identify the anime by a single frame</h3>
          <p>
            Trace Moe is an API that finds an anime series based on the frame
            you upload. You get a 1,000 monthly quota, and the whole thing is
            open source.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is seriously impressive. If you are a programmer and not an anime
            fan yet, these folks are lapping you in side projects. Just give up
            and join them already.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Your favorite apps probably have APIs - use the data you already
            have
          </h3>
          <p>
            I am tossing a bunch of these into one slot because the pattern is
            the same. Most of your favorite tools like Notion, Obsidian, Jira,
            and for me Todoist, have APIs you can call.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is your data, and if the app is not free, the API probably is not
            free either, but it unlocks custom workflows. Automate your task
            inbox, mirror notes to a website, or sync tickets to a custom
            dashboard.
          </p>

          <h3>Alpaca - automated stock trading the popular way</h3>
          <p>
            Alpaca is the most popular path to automated stock trading bots. The
            docs are clear and there are SDKs for pretty much every language.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could not sign up because I am Canadian, but if you can, it is a
            smooth build experience. You just need actual money to run it, which
            is not free, but the API is approachable.
          </p>

          <h3>NASA APIs - real data from space</h3>
          <p>
            NASA has a ton of APIs and they are all awesome. Where do you even
            begin.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are endpoints for astronomy pictures of the day, Mars weather
            observations, and so much more. You do not need an API key, but it
            is recommended if you want higher limits.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is some of the only open space data you can get, which makes it
            perfect for games, dashboards, or curiosity projects.
          </p>

          <h3>The Movie Database - TMDB for film nerds</h3>
          <p>
            TMDB is like IMDb but not owned by Amazon. One of my favorite apps
            is Letterboxd, and TMDB’s API reminds me how many incredible
            experiences you can build for movie lovers like me.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is free for non commercial use, so if you are building a small
            application for you and your friends, have fun. There are wrappers
            in a ton of languages to make it even easier.
          </p>

          <h3>DigiDates - one shot date utilities</h3>
          <p>
            Digi Dates helps you deal with dates without dragging in a giant
            dependency. Validate a date, check a leap year, things like that.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your project needs one tiny date function, pulling in Arrow for
            Python or Moment.js for JavaScript is overkill. One API endpoint can
            be perfect for the use case.

          <p>
            The OpenSky Network lets you track planes in real time, similar to
            those accounts that got banned for it. For open data, they offer
            clients in Python and Java, or you can just call the REST API.

            Map a flight path, build alerts, or create a cool public dashboard

            That is the vibe. Pick a couple of these endpoints, wire them
            together, and ship something delightful.

        <h2>
          Bottom Line: Pick Two APIs, Build One Feature, Ship This Weekend
        </h2>
        <p>
          You have 40 free APIs here that actually work in small apps. Images,
          video, games, news, finance, weather, maps, PDFs, email, speech,
          dictionaries, food, planes, movies, dates, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do not try to wire everything at once. Choose one visual API for
          delight and one data API for substance, then build a feature you would
          personally use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Watch your quotas, cache aggressively, and keep the docs right in your
          repo so your AI assistant can help. And when you get stuck, remember,
          half the fun of these free tiers is that you can experiment wildly
          without risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will be over here deploying that Waifu bot. See you on the next
          build.
        </p>
