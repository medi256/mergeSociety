        </h2>
        <p>
          Have you ever stopped to wonder exactly how much raw computational
          muscle sits inside your graphics card as you immerse yourself in the
          ultra-realistic worlds of today’s video games? If you guessed in the
          realm of 100 million calculations per second, you’d have just enough
          power to run <em>Super Mario 64</em>—back in 1996. Fast-forward to
          2011, and even the pixelated world of <em>Minecraft</em> required a
          system that could perform about 100 billion calculations each second.
        </p>
        <p>
          But today, if you want to run the graphical juggernauts like{" "}
          <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> at full fidelity, your graphics card needs to
          flex its silicon muscles to churn out an astronomical 36{" "}
          <strong>trillion</strong> calculations per second. Numbers this large
          can be hard to process—so let’s break it down for your imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine solving one multiplication problem every single second. Now,
          multiply that effort across every single person on earth. Even then,
          to match your GPU’s 36 trillion calculations per second, you’d need
          about 4,400 planets teeming with people, each solving a calculation
          every second! It’s mind-boggling to realize that a device sitting
          inside your PC performs what the populations of thousands of Earths
          could only dream of achieving.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this article, we’re going to embark on a deep-dive into the inner
          workings of a modern graphics card. We’ll break down complex systems
          into bite-sized, digestible explanations, and by the end, you’ll have
          a newfound appreciation for the silicon wizardry hidden inside your
          computer. We’ll explore this journey in two main parts:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Cracking open the graphics card to examine its components, delving
            into the physical architecture of the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
            itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            Investigating the computational architecture—explaining how GPUs
            process gigantic loads of data to excel at game graphics,
            cryptocurrency mining, neural networks, and AI.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Before we get started, it’s worth noting that this exploration is made
          possible with support from Micron, the maker of the advanced graphics
          memory inside the GPU we’ll be dissecting today.
        </p>

        <h2>CPU vs. GPU: The Ultimate Silicon Showdown</h2>
        <p>
          Before we jump headfirst into the guts of the GPU, let’s first clarify
          how GPUs compare to their more general-purpose sibling: the CPU
          (Central Processing Unit).
        </p>
        <p>
          The Graphics Processing Unit on a modern card boasts over 10,000
          cores—tiny calculators designed to churn through simple operations as
          quickly as possible. Contrast this to the typical CPU nestled on your
          motherboard, which contains only about 24 cores. Intuitively, one
          might think “More cores = more power!”—but, as with many things in
          technology, the reality is a bit more nuanced.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of it like this: Imagine a massive cargo ship (your GPU) and a
          jumbo jet airplane (your CPU). The ship can haul enormous amounts of
          cargo, albeit slowly, while the jet is fast, nimble, and can carry a
          variety of packages, including passengers, quickly to any destination.
          Similarly:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>GPUs</strong> are designed for a massive number of parallel
            operations, handling vast “cargoes” of data at a steadier pace, but
            with far less flexibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CPUs</strong> excel at handling diverse tasks and can
            respond rapidly to the unpredictable twists and turns of different
            applications—but can’t lug quite the same load in one go.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It’s not a perfect analogy, but it captures the key trade-off: For
          mountains of simple calculations, like rendering graphics, the GPU’s
          parallel muscle wins out. For fast, complex, and more versatile
          workloads—think running your operating system or connecting to the
          network—the CPU is the undisputed champion.

        <h2>The Anatomy of a Graphics Card: Dissecting the GPU</h2>
        <p>
          Let’s peel back the layers and look at what’s actually inside a
          high-end graphics card.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the heart of it all is the printed circuit board (PCB), bristling
          with precisely mounted components. The true brain is the graphics
          processing unit (GPU) die itself—like the NVIDIA GA102 chip,
          constructed from an astonishing 28.3 billion transistors. Most of this
          chip’s vast landscape is devoted to its processing cores, organized as
          follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>7 Graphics Processing Clusters (GPCs):</strong> The biggest
            core subdivisions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each GPC divides further into{" "}
            <strong>12 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs)</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each SM contains four groups called <strong>warps</strong> and a
            dedicated <strong>ray tracing core</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each <strong>warp</strong> houses 32{" "}
            <strong>CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) cores</strong>
            —the main workers—and one <strong>tensor core</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All told, the full GA102 boasts 10,752 CUDA cores, 336 tensor cores,
          and 84 ray tracing cores—each optimized for a different flavor of
          math.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>CUDA cores:</strong> Think of these as ultra-fast
            calculators for addition, multiplication, and other basic
            arithmetic. They’re the workhorses for gaming graphics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tensor cores:</strong> Specialized for matrix multiplication
            and addition, vital for geometric transformations, AI training, and
            neural network operations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ray tracing cores:</strong> Exceptionally powerful (but
            fewer in number) units that handle the complex math behind realistic
            lighting and reflections.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Here’s a fascinating quirk: the same GA102 chip design is used across
          several flagship NVIDIA graphics cards, including the 3080, 3090, 3080
          Ti, and 3090 Ti—even though these sell for different prices and were
          released in different years. Why? Because chip manufacturing is never
          perfect. Tiny defects, such as dust or patterning errors, are almost
          inevitable. Rather than toss out a whole chip due to a small flaw,
          engineers can turn off the affected region. This modular, “repetitive”
          design means one defective area (say, a streaming multiprocessor) can
          be deactivated, allowing the rest of the chip to work flawlessly.
        </p>
        <p>As a result, chips are “binned” (sorted) by quality:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>3090 Ti:</strong> All 10,752 CUDA cores intact—the top-tier,
            flawless chips.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3090:</strong> 10,496 working cores.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3080 Ti:</strong> 10,240 working cores.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3080:</strong> 8,704 working cores (with about 16 streaming
            multiprocessors disabled).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Differences in clock speed, memory type, and quantity further
          distinguish these cards—but the GPU “DNA” remains the same.
        </p>

        <h2>A Closer Look at the CUDA Core: The Simplest Super Calculator</h2>
        <p>
          Zooming into a single CUDA core, you’ll find a marvelously efficient
          calculator—this core, occupying around 410,000 transistors,
          orchestrates several fundamental mathematical operations. A key
          sub-region of about 50,000 transistors performs the crucial Fused
          Multiply-Add (FMA)—that is, <code>a × b + c</code> in one go, the
          single most common operation in graphics processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Half the CUDA cores handle these FMAs using 32-bit floating point
          (scientific notation) numbers, while the others tackle 32-bit integers
          or floats as needed. Additional circuitry equips the core for negative
          numbers, bit shifts, masking, managing instruction queues,
          accumulating results, and outputting data. In essence: it’s a
          lightning-fast, highly focused calculator, ticking away one
          multiply-add combo per clock cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiply this by 10,496 cores at a brisk 1.7 GHz clock speed (as in
          the 3090 graphics card), and you get 35.6 trillion calculations per
          second! For more complex functions—division, square roots, trig—the
          chip uses “special function units.” There are only four of these per
          streaming multiprocessor, making them rarer but vital for fancy math.
        </p>

        <h2>Beyond the Core: Around the GPU Die</h2>
        <p>
          Encircling the processing heart of the GA102 are key supporting
          structures:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>12 graphics memory controllers</strong> for blazing-fast
            access,
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>NVLink controllers</strong> for linking multiple GPUs,
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>PCIe interface</strong> for connection to your motherboard,
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>6 MB Level 2 memory cache</strong> (SRAM)—acting as
            ultra-fast scratchpad storage,
          </li>
          <li>
            The <strong>GigaThread engine</strong>, orchestrating task
            assignments and managing the chip’s workflow.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Beyond the die, you’ll spot the display ports, the beefy 12V power
          connector (supplying hundreds of watts!), and PCIe pins for
          motherboard interaction. The countless tiny bits and
          pieces—collectively known as the Voltage Regulator Module (VRM)—step
          down power to the precise 1.1V needed by the GPU core. Heat’s a major
          concern; thus, a massive heatsink and four heat pipes ferry thermal
          energy away from the GPU and memory chips to radiator fins, with fans
          whirring to keep things cool.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>And of course, there’s graphics memory:</strong> In the 3090,
          24 GB of ultra-fast GDDR6X SDRAM from Micron. When you see a loading
          screen in a game, most of that wait is just your system copying the
          required 3D models from storage into this dedicated memory. As you
          play, the GPU’s tiny 6MB cache holds just a fraction of the scene, so
          chunks of the game’s environments are streamed relentlessly between
          memory and GPU, feeding the insatiable appetite of those trillions of
          calculating cores.
        </p>
        <p>
          These memory chips aren’t just fast—they’re designed for{" "}
          <strong>parallelism</strong>: the 24 chips transfer data across a
          384-bit “bus” at once, achieving a ludicrous bandwidth of 1.15
          terabytes per second. For context, the CPU’s memory (DRAM) runs with a
          mere 64-bit bus, maxing out at about 64 gigabytes per second.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s a twist: While most think computers speak only in binary
          (zeroes and ones), new GDDR6X and GDDR7 graphics memory uses a
          multi-level approach. Instead of simple highs and lows, they leverage
          multiple voltage levels per wire, allowing far more data to move in a
          single tick:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>GDDR7:</strong> Uses “PAM3” encoding, combining binary bits
            into ternary digits (0, 1, -1). For example, three binary bits are
            efficiently encoded into two ternary digits. An advanced mapping (11
            bits into 7 ternary digits) cleverly squeezes 276 bits of data down
            to 176 symbols.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>GDDR6X (found in the 3090):</strong> Implements “PAM4,”
            encoding two bits into four voltage levels.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Engineering at this level is truly an arms race: PAM3, adopted in
          GDDR7, offers reduced complexity, better power efficiency, and a
          better signal-to-noise ratio for even faster chips. Micron has
          continually pushed these innovations, even pioneering HBM
          (High-Bandwidth Memory), where DRAM chips are stacked into vertical
          “cubes,” connected by through-silicon vias (TSVs).
        </p>
        <p>
          In HBM3e, one memory cube (think, a skyscraper made from microchips)
          offers up to 36 GB of high-speed capacity. So when you hear about AI
          systems packed with up to 192 GB of “stacked” memory—know there’s some
          serious, Micron-backed sorcery fueling that feat!
        </p>
        <p>
          For most of us, flagship AI “accelerator” boards are out of reach—they
          cost tens of thousands of dollars and are backordered for years. But
          if you’re interested in the science of advanced memory, or in building
          the next generation of chips, Micron is always hiring talented
          engineers.

        <h2>From Data to Reality: The GPU’s Parallel Power in Action</h2>
        <p>
          Now that we’ve mapped out the physical hardware, let’s talk
          architecture—how does the GPU’s computational design let it shred
          through tasks like game graphics and bitcoin mining?
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of these tasks are classified as{" "}
          <strong>“embarrassingly parallel.”</strong> While the name may draw a
          giggle, in technical terms it means the computation can be split into
          many smaller jobs, each working independently with almost no
          coordination—perfectly suited to thousands of parallel cores.
        </p>
        <p>
          The operating principle is{" "}
          <strong>SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data):</strong> the same
          calculation is performed across loads of different data points at the
          same time.
        </p>
        <h3>Example: Building a Virtual Cowboy Hat</h3>
        <p>
          Imagine a 3D cowboy hat resting on a table in a game scene. The hat’s
          modeled from about 28,000 triangles—each triangle defined by three
          “vertices.” That’s roughly 14,000 unique points, each with X, Y, and Z
          spatial coordinates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every 3D object you see in the scene—tables, chairs, hats,
          robots—exists in its own <strong>model space</strong>, with
          coordinates like (0,0,0) marking the center of the object. To build a
          full 3D world, engines position these objects together, each with its
          own local origin. However, the camera needs to know where every object
          sits relative to everything else. The solution: You convert—or
          “transform”—each set of object-centric coordinates into a shared{" "}
          <strong>world space</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Here’s how parallel math shines:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            For our 14,000 cowboy hat vertices, you simply add the hat’s
            position in world space to each local coordinate. It’s a quick,
            identical operation—but must be done for every point.
          </li>
          <li>
            The same applies for the table, chair, and every other
            object—hundreds of thousands, even millions, of similar
            calculations.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In practice, this scene may require converting 8.3 million
          vertices—demanding 25 million addition operations. <br />
          But here’s the beauty: None of these calculations rely on the others.
          Each one can fire off on a different CUDA core, all working in
          glorious parallel.
        </p>
        <p>
          This example is a single stage (model-to-world transformation) of a
          much deeper graphics rendering pipeline. The actual
          rendering—rotation, scaling, lighting, shading—involves many
          additional steps, nearly all of which are “embarrassingly parallel.”
        </p>

        <h3>
          SIMD, SIMT, and Scheduling Threads: Marching in Lockstep (and Beyond)
        </h3>
        <p>
          These parallel operations are implemented via “threads”—tiny units of
          computation matched directly to CUDA cores. Threads are grouped:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Warps:</strong> Groups of 32 threads executing the same
            instructions together.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Thread Blocks:</strong> Collections of warps, managed by
            Streaming Multiprocessors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Grids:</strong> Aggregations of thread blocks dispatched
            across the whole GPU.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>The GigaThread Engine</strong> oversees this complex
          choreography, mapping job blocks to available multiprocessors for
          maximum throughput.
        </p>
        <p>
          Traditionally, every thread within a warp had to stay precisely “in
          step”—executing exactly the same instruction at the same time (think
          of a Roman phalanx). This is the basis of{" "}
          <strong>SIMD architecture</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In modern GPUs, however, NVIDIA and others have advanced to{" "}
          <strong>SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads):</strong> Each
          thread gets its own program counter, meaning it can run independently
          and isn’t forced to stay in lockstep with the rest of its warp. This
          offers greater flexibility, especially when some threads need to
          branch or pause due to different data. SIMT also includes a shared
          cache system (128 KB L1 per multiprocessor) so threads can pass data
          around as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In layman’s terms, SIMT means GPUs are even more efficient at keeping
          all their cores busy, even when tasks diverge or branch in
          unpredictable ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          (A fun aside: the term “warp” here doesn’t come from Star Trek, but
          instead, weaving—referencing the Jacquard loom from 1804, which used
          punch cards to select threads for making complex patterns.)
        </p>

        <h2>Real-World Applications: Bitcoin Mining and Neural Networks</h2>
        <h3>Bitcoin Mining: Harnessing Parallel Power for Profit</h3>
        <p>
          Let’s talk Bitcoin. Mining for cryptocurrency was one of the earliest
          “killer apps” for powerful GPUs. Here’s how it works:
        </p>
        <p>
          The Bitcoin blockchain requires blocks to be validated via the SHA-256
          hashing algorithm. This process takes transaction data—plus a
          timestamp, some extra bits, and a variable called a "nonce"—and
          combines them to generate a random 256-bit hash. It’s a bit like a
          lottery ticket generator: each new nonce spits out a new “ticket.”
        </p>
        <p>
          To win (i.e., earn Bitcoin), miners race to find a hash value where
          the first 80 bits are zeros. The more SHA-256 hashes you can compute
          in a second, the better your chances.
        </p>
        <p>
          GPUs could run thousands of these attempts in parallel, each thread
          crunching a different nonce with identical base data. A high-end
          graphics card could generate ~95 million hashes per second—massively
          outpacing CPUs.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, dedicated mining machines called ASICs now rule the Bitcoin
          world (processing up to 250 trillion hashes per second!), making GPUs
          look quaint in comparison—a bit like bringing a spoon to an excavator
          fight.
        </p>

        <h3>AI, Tensor Cores, and Neural Networks</h3>
        <p>
          The tensor cores inside top GPUs were engineered to accelerate the
          bread-and-butter calculations of AI:{" "}
          <strong>matrix multiplication and addition.</strong> Here’s what
          happens:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The tensor core receives three matrices. First, it multiplies two of
            them (essentially summing the row-by-column products).
          </li>
          <li>Then, it adds in the third matrix.</li>
          <li>
            The result is output—and thanks to the highly parallel nature, all
            these calculations can happen simultaneously.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Neural networks and generative AI models require trillions (even
          quadrillions) of these matrix multiplications and additions—on far
          larger matrices than one would ever wish to calculate by hand. The
          tensor cores are designed precisely to crunch through this mountain of
          math at superhuman speed.
        </p>

        <h3>Ray Tracing Cores: Lighting the Future of Graphics</h3>
        <p>
          Finally, let’s not forget ray tracing cores. While already explored in
          depth in a separate article, these specialized units simulate the
          complex physics of light—enabling jaw-droppingly realistic
          reflections, shadows, and lighting in real-time 3D environments.
        </p>

        <h2>In Closing: The Magic Behind Every Frame</h2>
        <p>
          The next time you load up a hyper-realistic video game, watch an AI
          beatbox, or marvel at blockchain technology, take a moment to
          appreciate the feat of parallel computing humming beneath your
          fingertips. Your graphics card, powered by brilliant engineering and
          relentless innovation, brings ideas to life—not just by working
          quickly, but by multiplying that speed by thousands.
