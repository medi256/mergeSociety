        </h2>

        <p>
          AI is officially here. Whether you're thrilled, skeptical, or just
          hoping the robots stay out of your bathroom breaks, one thing is
          clear: artificial intelligence is already changing the landscape of
          software development. And it's not just hype anymore—developers across
          the world are leveraging AI as a powerful productivity boost, while
          others (like the author of this article) are embracing it for both
          efficiency and fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each week, there’s a new AI startup, a new large language model
          release, or a new CEO boldly proclaiming “programming is dead.”
          Meanwhile, indie hackers and influencers are chanting phrases like,
          “Vibe coding is the future.” Seriously, you can’t even make a quick
          pit stop without overhearing someone debating AI’s place in the modern
          coder’s toolkit: “You done in there? Get out!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet despite the noise, it’s impossible to deny that AI offers a lot of
          potential. Sure, there are limitations—AI is far from perfect—but it
          really can help developers work faster, learn better, and build
          projects more efficiently. Major companies are paying attention and,
          in some cases, embracing these technologies a little too eagerly
          (Shopify CEO, anyone?). If you’re a developer, ignoring AI is
          increasingly less of an option—unless you’re coding for government
          agencies or tightly regulated medical environments, in which case,
          enjoy your temporary haven. Even then, your colleagues may inevitably
          nudge you toward adopting AI.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, instead of waving AI off or watching from the sidelines, let’s
          dive into how to use it to code faster, learn quicker, and ultimately
          build cooler things. The strategies laid out below come straight from
          firsthand experience, with a healthy dash of practical wisdom,
          sponsored generously by <strong>Windsurf</strong>—so I can demonstrate
          all these techniques in action.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article is hands-on. If you’re looking for the latest
          philosophical screaming match about whether AI tools are the downfall
          of civilization, you’re probably in the wrong place. But if you want
          actionable advice on becoming a smarter programmer with AI as your
          sidekick, stick around.
        </p>

        <h2>Is Using AI Tools for Coding Cheating?</h2>
        <p>
          The notion that AI code assistants are “cheating” or make us lazier
          developers is everywhere. Are they secretly going to replace us all?
          Are we turning into button-clickers rather than problem-solvers? The
          short answer: <strong>No. Just… no. Well, not yet.</strong> If you
          find yourself wrestling with these thoughts, don’t worry—most of us
          have been there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pitfall is in treating AI as an all-or-nothing solution. Some
          developers think they must exclusively rely on AI, handing over their
          programming soul to the machine gods. Others refuse to touch it at
          all, as if using AI will erase their hard-earned expertise. The truth?
          Sensible programmers understand that you don’t have to go to either
          extreme. The real trick is knowing when AI genuinely helps, and when
          it’s best left on the sidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Go all in on AI right now and you'll run into problems: buggy code,
          insecure vulnerabilities, and the disorienting feeling of shipping
          entire apps without grasping what’s happening under the hood. The{" "}
          <strong>savviest developers</strong> don’t use AI to replace
          themselves, nor do they reject it outright. Instead, they treat AI
          like an unpaid intern—eager to help, easy to direct, and with zero HR
          complaints if you “let them go” for underperforming.
        </p>

        <h2>The Three Levels of AI Assistance: From Tutor to Agent</h2>
        <p>
          Here’s how I think about working with AI for programming: not as a
          monolithic replacement for my skillset, but as a flexible sidekick
          that operates at different levels, depending on my familiarity with
          the project. It’s all about balance—to avoid becoming a lazier,
          less-capable developer, I leverage AI in a tiered system. Let’s break
          down each level:
        </p>

        <h3>Level 1: The Tutor</h3>
        <p>
          When I’m learning a new framework, debugging unfamiliar code, or
          trying to climb the steep slope of a skill gap, I “hire” AI as my
          tutor. <strong>This is the learning phase.</strong> Here’s how I
          maximize AI’s benefit while retaining the challenge—and all-important
          learning—of problem-solving:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Turn off autocomplete:</strong> If AI offers to finish my
            thoughts, I’ll never learn the syntax or reasoning behind what I’m
            typing. This ensures that I absorb the concepts, rather than letting
            the assistant do the heavy lifting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Switch to chat mode:</strong> Instead of letting AI write
            code, I use chat to get explanations, code walkthroughs, and
            documentation references.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Platforms like <strong>Windsurf</strong> make this seamless. With
          code-specific chat features built right into the IDE—no more
          alt-tabbing between your code editor and generic ChatGPT tabs—these
          chats offer contextually relevant suggestions, references to functions
          and files, and more accurate help than a generic AI. Plus, Windsurf
          chat is <strong>free</strong>—a rare find in the world of developer
          tools.
        </p>
        <p>Here are typical things I ask “Tutor AI” to do:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Explain a gnarly chunk of code (sometimes realizing, embarrassingly,
            that I wrote it myself).
          </li>
          <li>Leave meaningful comments.</li>
          <li>Reference official docs or fetch examples from the web.</li>
          <li>Clarify concepts I’ve gotten rusty on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          One especially handy Windsurf feature: when you type <code>@</code> in
          chat, it surfaces all the relevant files and docs you can reference.
          Choose a doc, and Windsurf will search and read it for you. If it’s
          missing, drop in a link, and Windsurf will do the analysis. Super
          convenient.
        </p>
        <p>
          But sometimes, even in tutor mode, AI spills the answers. That’s not
          ideal—you want guidance, not spoon-feeding. Here’s my workaround:
          inspired by Windsurf’s own prompt library, I create a folder called{" "}
          <code>Docs</code>, add a markdown file (<code>Tutor.md</code>), and
          paste in a tailored prompt that instructs AI to behave like a research
          assistant—a “Socratic tutor” who only responds with questions unless I
          specifically request an answer. This way, I can toggle “tutor mode” on
          and off as needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          When activated, the AI starts by asking me probing questions to chart
          my understanding and guide my thinking, rather than simply dumping
          solutions. If you want to toggle it off, simply stop referencing the
          Tutor file, and AI reverts to its default helpful self. Win-win!
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach prevents AI from diminishing my problem-solving chops.
          I’m still writing the code, still thinking deeply about the problem,
          but I’m saving time on lookups and research. If you’re hungry for more
          tips and want to improve your programming game, don’t forget to check
          out my (free!) newsletter: <strong>Sloth Bites</strong>: the funkiest
          way to level up your dev news and tips.
        </p>

        <h3>Level 2: The Assistant</h3>
        <p>
          Once I’m more comfortable with a language or framework, I graduate to
          “assistant mode.” Here’s where I crank the autocomplete back on.
          Suddenly, AI is handling:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Generating schemas</li>
          <li>Renaming variables</li>
          <li>Writing tests</li>
          <li>Fixing obvious typos</li>
          <li>Adding repetitive comments</li>
          <li>Dealing with all that tireless boilerplate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These aren’t things I <em>can’t</em> do—I just don’t want to burn 30
          minutes on grunt work. Be honest: autocomplete might make you lazy
          (we’ve all paused mid-line, waiting for AI to finish our thought
          because typing is overrated). But since I already know what I wanted
          to say, and if AI guesses wrong, I can correct it instantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Caution:</strong> In interviews or classwork, this habit might
          be risky—if the rules prohibit AI, switch it off! But in real
          projects, autocomplete can help you flow through ideas quickly and
          reduce friction. As always, if you find yourself using autocomplete
          for code you don’t understand, step back to Tutor mode. The goal is
          support, not dependency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again—<strong>Windsurf’s autocomplete is free</strong>. You get
          an unpaid intern happy to both chat and fill in the code you don’t
          want to type. It’s the dream! In assistant mode, I keep chat open for
          questions about organization, best practices, and alternate
          implementations, but still avoid letting it write entire features.
          That’s reserved for the final level.
        </p>

        <h3>Level 3: The Agent</h3>
        <p>
          Windsurf calls their AI agent <strong>Cascade</strong>, which
          definitely sounds cooler than “The Intern Who Writes Code.” Here’s
          when I let the agent take the wheel: when I’m genuinely stuck, out of
          stamina, lack interest in the piece of code, or just want someone else
          (hopefully smarter) to take a crack at it. Throw in your screenshots,
          paste your design notes, describe your goal, and Cascade pulls
          together code for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, Cascade surprises me with genuinely creative solutions I
          hadn’t considered. Other times, it gets a bit cocky and goes off on a
          tangent—but that’s fine. Politely, or not-so-politely, you can tell
          the agent where it’s wrong and ask for a redo. No hurt feelings, no HR
          paperwork.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this stage, I become the manager: reviewing, tweaking, and testing
          code rather than writing every line. Cascade (or your AI agent of
          choice) is never going to build your dream app solo—it needs your
          direction and oversight and, crucially, your expertise to catch
          mistakes. But as a “second brain,” it's an incredible resource for
          unblocking progress or automating the mundane.
        </p>
        <p>
          Want to make Cascade (and similar AI agents) even smarter? Look into
          tools like “memories,” custom rules, or MCPs (modular code
          prompts)—they’re trending for good reason. (Let me know if you want a
          deep-dive in my next article!)
        </p>

        <h2>Key Takeaways: AI as Your Flexible Ally</h2>
        <p>
          The most important lesson:{" "}
          <strong>you don’t have to use every feature, every time</strong>. Pick
          and choose what helps for your current skill level and needs. Turn
          autocomplete off when you want to stretch your problem-solving
          muscles; activate the agent only when it makes sense for your
          workflow. At the end of the day, AI is just a tool—a tool that, used
          wisely, can supercharge your productivity without diminishing your
          expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI coding tools aren’t going to instantly transform anyone into a
          legendary “10x engineer.” But if they can make you 5% faster without
          eroding your abilities, why not give them a shot? Great developers
          adapt to new tools and technologies—they don’t fear them. What matters
          is knowing what you’re building, why it matters, and how to fix things
          when the unexpected happens. That’s the real developer superpower.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those looking to try AI in a thoughtful, hype-free way,{" "}
          <strong>Windsurf</strong> offers an intuitive UI, toggleable features,
          and a surprisingly generous free tier for both chat and autocomplete.
          Perfect for getting your feet wet (or taking a deep dive).
