        <p>
          React, a popular JavaScript library, continues to evolve. One of the
          most revolutionary changes came in the form of{" "}
          <strong>React Hooks</strong>, introduced in React 16.8. Hooks allow
          you to use state and other React features in functional components,
          which were previously only available in class components. In this
          post, we’ll explore the world of React Hooks, covering their
          importance, how to use them, and why they are an essential tool for
          developers in 2025.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>What Are React Hooks?</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>React Hooks</strong> are functions that let you “hook into”
          React state and lifecycle features from function components. They
          provide a way to use stateful logic without having to convert your
          components into classes. This means less boilerplate code and a more
          intuitive way to manage component logic.
        </p>
        <p>The most commonly used hooks include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>useState:</strong> Allows you to add state to a functional
            component.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>useEffect:</strong> Lets you perform side effects in
            function components, such as fetching data or updating the DOM.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>useContext:</strong> Gives you access to context values in
            functional components.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>useRef:</strong> Provides a way to reference DOM elements or
            persist values across renders.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>The Advantages of React Hooks</h2>
        <p>
          Hooks have transformed how developers approach building applications
          in React. Here are the key benefits of using React Hooks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cleaner Code:</strong> With hooks, there’s no need for
            lifecycle methods like <code>componentDidMount</code> or
            <code>componentDidUpdate</code>. Hooks simplify code by combining
            these methods into a single <code>useEffect</code> call.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stateful Functional Components:</strong> Before hooks, state
            could only be managed in class components. Now, with
            <code>useState</code>, functional components can manage their own
            state.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reusability of Logic:</strong> Hooks encourage the reuse of
            logic between components by allowing developers to create custom
            hooks. This avoids repetitive code and makes it easier to organize.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Easier Testing:</strong> Hooks make it easier to test
            component logic by separating concerns, meaning you can test
            individual pieces of functionality in isolation.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Diving Into Key React Hooks</h2>

        <h3>1. useState</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>useState</strong> hook is one of the most basic and widely
          used hooks in React. It allows you to add state to functional
          components, something that was previously only possible in class
          components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s a basic example of using <code>useState</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="react" style={docco}>
              {`const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );`}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In this example, we use <code>useState</code> to create a stateful{" "}
          <code>count</code> variable, which starts at 0. The
          <code>setCount</code> function allows us to update the state, and
          clicking the button increments the count.
        </p>

        <h3>2. useEffect</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>useEffect</strong> hook is used to handle side effects
          like fetching data, manually updating the DOM, or setting up
          subscriptions. It combines the functionality of
          <code>componentDidMount</code>, <code>componentDidUpdate</code>, and
          <code>componentWillUnmount</code> in class components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s an example using <code>useEffect</code>:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="react" style={docco}>
              {`useEffect(() => {
  document.title = \`You clicked \${count} times\`;
}, [count]);`}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In this code, the <code>useEffect</code> hook updates the document
          title every time the <code>count</code> changes. The second parameter
          is an array of dependencies. The effect will only run when one of the
          dependencies changes.
        </p>

        <h3>3. useContext</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>useContext</strong> hook provides a way to consume context
          values within functional components. Instead of passing props through
          multiple layers of components, <code>useContext</code>
          allows you to get values directly from the context.
        </p>
        <p>Here’s a simple example:</p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="react" style={docco}>
              {`const user = useContext(UserContext);

return <p>Logged in as: {user.name}</p>;`}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This hook allows your component to access the <code>UserContext</code>{" "}
          directly without needing to pass props down manually.
        </p>

        <h3>4. useRef</h3>
        <p>
          The <strong>useRef</strong> hook is used to persist values across
          renders or directly access DOM elements. It’s similar to
          <code>createRef</code> in class components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example of using <code>useRef</code> to focus an input field:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="react" style={docco}>
              {`const inputRef = useRef(null);

useEffect(() => {
  inputRef.current.focus();
}, []);

return <input ref={inputRef} />;`}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Custom Hooks</h2>
        <p>
          One of the most powerful features of React hooks is the ability to
          create <strong>custom hooks</strong>. These are functions that allow
          you to extract and reuse logic across multiple components. Custom
          hooks usually start with the word "use", just like React’s built-in
          hooks.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, let’s create a simple custom hook that tracks window
          width:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="react" style={docco}>
              {`function useWindowWidth() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);

    return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
  }, []);

  return width;
}`}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This custom hook can now be used in any component to easily access the
          window width:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="react" style={docco}>
              {`const width = useWindowWidth();
return <p>Window width: {width}</p>;`}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          React Hooks have fundamentally changed the way we write React
          applications. They simplify code, improve readability, and make it
          easier to reuse logic between components. Whether you're building a
          small personal project or a large-scale application, React Hooks are
          an essential tool that will help you write clean, maintainable code in
          2025 and beyond.
