            protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Implementation:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Obtain an SSL/TLS certificate (Consider free options like Let's
                Encrypt).
              </li>
              <li>Configure your web server to use HTTPS.</li>
              <li>Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) headers.</li>
              <li>Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Best practices:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Use strong cipher suites and disable outdated protocols.</li>
              <li>Regularly renew and update your SSL/TLS certificates.</li>
