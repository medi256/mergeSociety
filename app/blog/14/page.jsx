          <li>

        <h2>Exploring Google Search Console Features</h2>

        <h3>1. Performance Report</h3>
        <p>
          The performance report is your go-to feature for tracking how your
          website performs in Google Search. It provides metrics like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Total clicks: How many users clicked through to your site.</li>
          <li>
            Impressions: The number of times your site appeared in search
            results.
          </li>
          <li>
            Average CTR: The percentage of users who clicked your link after
            seeing it in search results.
          </li>
          <li>
            Average position: Your site’s average ranking for the selected
            queries.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use these metrics to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Identify high-performing keywords and queries.</li>
          <li>
            Find pages with low CTR and optimize them for better titles and meta
            descriptions.
          </li>
          <li>Track your ranking progress over time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. URL Inspection Tool</h3>
        <p>
          If you’ve made changes to your content or added new pages, the URL
          Inspection Tool helps ensure they are indexed by Google. By submitting
          the URL for inspection, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Check if the page is currently indexed.</li>
          <li>View any crawling or indexing issues.</li>
          <li>Submit the page for re-indexing after updates.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This tool is invaluable when publishing new blog posts or making
          updates to old content.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Core Web Vitals & Page Experience</h3>
        <p>
          In 2024, Google places even more emphasis on user experience, with
          Core Web Vitals being a critical ranking factor. The three key metrics
          are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):</strong> Measures how
            quickly the main content loads.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FID (First Input Delay):</strong> Gauges how responsive your
            page is.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):</strong> Evaluates how stable
            your page layout is.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Page Experience report in GSC highlights how well your site
          performs in these areas and offers suggestions to improve your scores.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Mobile Usability Report</h3>
        <p>
          Mobile usability remains a top-ranking factor as mobile traffic
          continues to dominate. The Mobile Usability Report shows issues that
          prevent your site from being mobile-friendly, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Content wider than the screen.</li>
          <li>Clickable elements too close together.</li>
          <li>Text too small to read.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Fixing these issues ensures that your site meets Google’s mobile-first
          indexing standards.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Coverage Report</h3>
        <p>
          The Coverage Report gives insights into how Google crawls and indexes
          your site. It shows pages that are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Valid:</strong> Indexed without issues.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Error:</strong> Pages that couldn’t be indexed due to
            problems like server errors or redirect loops.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Excluded:</strong> Pages deliberately left out (e.g., via
            robots.txt or canonical tags).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By identifying and fixing errors here, you can ensure all important
          pages are indexed properly.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Enhancements</h3>
        <p>
          Under the Enhancements tab, you'll find reports on structured data
          elements like breadcrumbs, product schema, or FAQ schema. These
          reports show how well Google can read your structured data and if
          there are any errors to fix.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using structured data can help your site appear in rich results,
          enhancing visibility in search.
