          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            As a web developer, one of the first things you’ll need to master is
            layouts. How do you position elements on a page so that they look
            great on all screen sizes? CSS has evolved to give developers
            powerful tools for creating flexible and responsive layouts.
            <strong> CSS Grid</strong> and <strong>Flexbox</strong> are two of
            the most popular and versatile layout techniques available. But when
            should you use one over the other? In this blog post, we’ll explore
            the differences between Grid and Flexbox and help you decide which
            to use for your next project.

          <h2>Understanding Flexbox</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Flexbox</strong> (Flexible Box Layout) is a one-dimensional
            layout method that allows you to control how items are arranged
            either in a row or column. It's perfect for creating layouts where
            you want elements to align or distribute space along a single axis
            (either horizontally or vertically).
          </p>
          <h3>Key Features of Flexbox</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>One-Dimensional Layout:</strong> Flexbox deals with layout
              in one direction at a time—either a row or a column. It’s ideal
              for simple layouts, like a navigation bar, or aligning items
              within a container.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Alignment and Distribution:</strong> Flexbox excels in
              aligning elements along the main or cross axis. You can easily
              center elements, space them evenly, or push them to one side of a
              container.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Responsive Adjustments:</strong> Items inside a flex
              container adjust their size and position based on available space,
              making Flexbox highly adaptable for responsive designs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            One of the most common uses for Flexbox is laying out navigation
            bars or aligning content within a single column or row. Here's a
            simple example:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="css" style={docco}>
                {`
  .flex-container {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
  }
  .flex-item {
    margin: 10px;
  }
            `}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Understanding CSS Grid</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>CSS Grid</strong> is a two-dimensional layout system that
            allows you to control both rows and columns. It’s perfect for
            creating complex layouts that require items to be positioned across
            multiple rows and columns.
          </p>
          <h3>Key Features of CSS Grid</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Two-Dimensional Layout:</strong> Grid lets you control
              both horizontal (columns) and vertical (rows) alignment. It’s
              especially useful for more complex layouts like grids, dashboards,
              or multi-column designs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Explicit and Implicit Grids:</strong> With CSS Grid, you
              can define the exact number of rows and columns, or allow the grid
              to implicitly create them based on content.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Layering and Overlapping:</strong> Grid allows for
              positioning elements in overlapping layers, something Flexbox
              cannot do.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            CSS Grid is perfect for projects where you need complete control
            over both rows and columns. Here's an example of how to define a
            simple grid layout:
          </p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="css" style={docco}>
                {`
  .grid-container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-gap: 10px;
  }
  .grid-item {
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #f1f1f1;
  }
            `}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </section>

          <h2>Flexbox vs. Grid: When to Use Which?</h2>
          <p>
            Now that we’ve covered the basics of both Flexbox and CSS Grid,
            let’s look at when you should use each. While both systems are
            powerful, they excel in different scenarios.
          </p>

          <h3>1. Use Flexbox When:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Aligning items along a single axis:</strong> Flexbox is
              perfect for laying out items in a row or column. If your design
              needs horizontal or vertical alignment—like a navigation bar or a
              set of buttons—Flexbox is the better option.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dealing with simple layouts:</strong> Flexbox is
              lightweight and ideal for straightforward layouts where you don’t
              need control over both rows and columns.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Use CSS Grid When:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Creating complex, two-dimensional layouts:</strong> CSS
              Grid shines when you need control over both rows and columns. It’s
              perfect for building entire webpage layouts, dashboards, or
              multi-column designs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Precise placement of elements:</strong> If you need
              specific placement of elements across a grid, CSS Grid allows you
              to define exactly where each item should go.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In some cases, you might find that using both Flexbox and Grid in
            the same project makes the most sense. For example, you could use
            Grid for the overall page layout and Flexbox for aligning items
            within a particular section.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are essential tools in modern web design.
            Flexbox is the best choice for simpler, one-dimensional layouts
            where you need items to align along a single axis, while Grid is
            ideal for more complex, two-dimensional designs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, the decision between CSS Grid and Flexbox depends on
            your project’s needs. Understanding the strengths of each system
            will help you build more flexible, responsive, and maintainable
            layouts. With both tools in your toolkit, you’re well-equipped to
            create stunning, user-friendly designs.
