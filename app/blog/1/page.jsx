        <ol>
          <li>
            I don't like the idea of being a wasted potential so will do
            anything in my power to fight it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Am so much influenced by Zuck, Elon and Bill so will work hard to
            Build wealth like the way they did
          </li>
          <li>

            something which can that can generate income to take care of my
            beloved ones.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have a deep passion for creating something through programming. As
            I mentioned earlier, I am inspired by Bill, Zuck, and Elon, and I
            aspire to build a generational tech company like they did.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Choose a field & a programming language</h2>
        <p>
          Spend the time and research what field you want to do, then choose the
          <strong>popular programming language</strong> for that path.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Here are some popular programming languages and the type of fields
          they can be used in:
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Python</strong>: It is a programming language used in a
            variety of fields. It is particularly popular for data science,
            machine learning, and game development, with libraries like Pandas
            and TensorFlow commonly used in data analysis and AI development.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>JavaScript:</strong> It is a programming language primarily
            used in web development, along with HTML and CSS, to add
            interactivity to webpages.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Java:</strong>Is another popular programming language used
            in building mobile apps
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Stick to study plan</h2>
        <p>
          Find a study plan that works for you and grow yourself to it. This is
          very important to the next steps
        </p>
        <h2>How to study</h2>
        <p>
          Instead of airfying my brain cells with a long course. I will hunt for
          the information using my study plan
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Look what topic to do: eg loops</li>
          <li>Search the topic only :</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Watch a short video</li>
            <li>Read docs or articles</li>
          </ol>
          <li>Ask AI to clear doubts</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why go hunting</h2>
        <p>
          Searching for information is a huge part of being a good programmer.
          tbh this what will be the rest life look like (no exaggeration )
        </p>
        <h2>Focus on understanding</h2>
        <p>
          Don't rush to zombie code, but try to actively understand the
          different parts of your code by asking questions{" "}
        </p>
        <h2>Topic Focused Exercise </h2>
        <p>
          After learning a topic do exercise on them so you are comfortable with
          everything{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Code is like building muscles, to train specific muscles grow you do
          specific exercise.
        </p>
        <h2>Connecting The Points</h2>
        <p>
          Being good at just one part isn’t enough; we need to spend more time
          connecting everything we’ve learned. So, every time you move on to a
          new topic, think of it as a challenge where you can apply what you’ve
          learned so far
        </p>
        <h3>Resources</h3>
        <h4>Roadmaps/study plan</h4>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>

        <p>
          {" "}
