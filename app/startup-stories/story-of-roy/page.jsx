          decided to go all-in on building crazy stuff and living with the
          consequences.

          <h2>Quick context before we get into it</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, my name is Roy. I founded this company called Cluely and I
            just got kicked out of Columbia University for building this tool
            called Interview Coder. It’s like a cheating tool for software
            engineering, technical interviews. I use the technology to build a
            much bigger company, Cluely - the desktop app that lets you cheat on
            everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now we just launched about few months ago, closing in on $5
            million in annually recurring revenue. And we also just closed a
            $5.3 million seed round led by Abstract Ventures and Suse Ventures.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s the headline. But if you only see the headline, you’re going
            to miss the actual story - the grind, the doubt, the tweets, the
            hate, the pressure, the product decisions, and why I’m convinced
            this is a turning point for how humans think and work. So here’s the
            complete breakdown, exactly as I lived it, no detail left out.
          </p>

          <h2>Who I was before all this</h2>
          <p>
            I was a pretty - I was pretty wild kid. I got in a lot of trouble. I
            was pretty smart. I think I was pretty good at math. I did a bit of
            math competition when I was younger.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I say “wild,” I don’t mean the cartoon version of rebellious. I
            mean I was restless, curious, always pushing against rules because I
            wanted to test where the boundaries were. That restlessness showed
            up early - in classrooms, in how I argued with teachers, in the
            kinds of hobbies I picked up and dropped. I wasn’t trying to be a
            problem child, I just judged things by whether they were fun,
            challenging, or a game I could win. If it felt like a game, I locked
            in. If it felt like a chore, I ran.
          </p>
          <p>
            Math felt like a game. Competitions were a rush. You sit down in a
            cold room with a pencil, some scratch paper, and questions that look
            like riddles disguised as math. The timer starts and your brain
            either lights up or goes blank. Mine lit up. I liked the feeling of
            seeing a clean trick, spotting a pattern, beating the problem before
            the time ran out. I wasn’t a prodigy or anything, but I learned to
            think with structure and speed. I learned how to stare at a question
            and ask myself: what’s this really testing?
          </p>
          <p>
            I was on like the debate team. Debate scratched a different itch -
            it’s chess with people. You stand up, your heart is beating, and you
            have to think faster than your mouth while also sounding like you’ve
            been ready for this question your whole life. You learn how to frame
            points, how to bend a narrative, how to read a room and know when to
            be sharp and when to be playful. Those tournaments taught me a lot
            about pressure. They also taught me to stop fearing other people’s
            judgment. When a judge writes, “confident, aggressive, compelling,”
            you remember it. When they write, “rambles, unfocused,” you remember
            that too and you fix it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I played some cello. That was discipline more than anything else.
            Practicing scales when all your friends are out, trying to keep a
            smooth tone when your fingers are numb - it’s not glamorous. But it
            shaped how I approach hard work. You repeat the motion until your
            hands remember it better than your brain. There’s a lot of that in
            coding too - you grind patterns, you iterate, you fix tiny errors
            until the whole thing sounds smooth.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love girls. You know, every year I had a new girlfriend. That’s
            not a flex - it’s just the truth of how social I was, how much I
            liked connection, how I was always chasing something new. It also
            meant I was always learning people - what they say, what they don’t
            say, who needs directness versus gentleness. I didn’t know it then,
            but that skill would be useful later online when the comments come
            flying and you need to know which ones matter and which ones are
            just noise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yeah, my mom made me do a lot of studying, but I hated studying. I
            was always trying to go out and like, like, like, like have fun,
            play with my friends. She would push textbooks toward me and I would
            angle toward the door. But she didn’t let go. She kept reminding me
            that the habits you build when you’re young turn into the person you
            become. So I studied. Not because I loved it, but because she said,
            do it, and I listened. And honestly, I’m grateful. That basic
            discipline got me into good programs, good circles, and gave me a
            scoreboard to chase.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ve always been very competitive. When I was a kid, I had a - I
            have an older brother who’s two years older than me. I always wanted
            to be like, smarter than him. I always wanted to do better and great
            at school than him. Sibling rivalry teaches you speed, it teaches
            you grit, and it teaches you how to convert jealousy into fuel. I
            wanted to beat him in grades, in clubs, in anything that had a list
            or ranking at the end.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m always trying to win. I’m trying to be Cheongyu Il Tung at
            everything. You know, like top of the class in the world of software
            engineering. That phrase - Cheongyu Il Tung - is how I think about
            it: number one, top of the heap, first among peers. It’s not about
            being perfect. It’s about deciding that if there’s a ranking, then
            I’m going to climb it. If there’s a leaderboard, I’m going to see my
            name on it. That’s my default setting. It’s not always healthy, but
            it makes me dangerous when I commit.

          <h2>Big tech interviews are broken</h2>
          <p>
            If you want to get a job at a big tech company, you have to answer
            these sort of riddle-esque questions that are called leetcode
            questions. And pretty much every developer you know at a big company
            has gone through the gauntlet of memorizing 600, 300 riddles and
            just sort of like memorizing solutions and regurgitating them in
            interviews.
          </p>
          <p>
            I, I’m very, very competitive. So the second I knew that there was
            like a ranking on leetcode, like a global ranking, I knew I had to
            be like one of the best. So I, I spent hundreds of hours studying,
            grinding the riddles. Even though I like, I don’t care about
            leetcode, I didn’t enjoy it. I didn’t really have a good time, but I
            was just competitive. So I thought like, if there’s a ranking, then
            I gotta be on the top of the ranking. But I mean, it just ended up
            with me wasting a bunch of hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leetcode just has nothing to do with what you do on the job. It’s
            like the modern day equivalent of asking how many balloons fit in
            the Empire State Building. It’s supposed to test your critical
            thinking. But the questions are online to the extent that rather
            than practicing critical thinking, you just practice memorizing the
            riddles. You’re going to sit through and memorize all the 1000
            questions because it means you get a 200k a year job.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is not good for anybody. You don’t. You don’t learn anything
            from practicing these riddles, and you just end up wasting time when
            you should be programming. I thought this was pretty stupid. And
            this has been going on for around 20 years right now.

          <h2>The spark: build the tool nobody wanted to admit they needed</h2>
          <p>
            The technology was there to sort of develop this tool that would
            invisibly let you use AI to cheat on these interviews. So I built
            the tool. I publicly recorded myself using it on the Amazon
            interview. I got the job, and I posted this everywhere, saying, look
            how easy it is to hack these interviews. Eventually, this got me in
            some trouble. But the impetus of everything was when I decided that
            it’s just a stupid industry practice and I wanted to change it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here’s what that looked like in real life. I sat down for the
            interview with a clean desktop. When the interviewer started
            talking, I let Interview Coder listen in. The translucent overlay
            appeared like a ghost layer on my screen - not blocking anything,
            just floating, whispering context, code patterns, hints, strategies.
            It wasn’t writing full solutions for me - it was reading the room
            and helping me decide what to do next, in real time. When the
            problem landed, the overlay distilled the ask into something
            actionable: data structure, complexity target, potential pitfalls,
            edge cases to mention out loud, a skeleton to type. It felt like
            playing with wallhacks turned on. You still need to aim, you still
            need to move, but suddenly you can see the whole map.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I got the yes, I didn’t keep it quiet. I posted it. Everywhere.
            Not as a humble brag, but as a giant flashing sign: this is
            gameable. If I can do it, anyone can do it. And if anyone can do it,
            then the game is broken, and the rules need to change.
          </p>

          <h2>The month where nothing happened and everything almost died</h2>
          <p>
            A lot of people think it was explosive from the start, but it took
            about a month before it really started to take off. And for a month,
            I posted everything. Amazon saw was getting mad at me and Columbia
            University saw and was getting mad at me, and everyone was just. And
            it didn’t really go that viral for about a month.
          </p>
          <p>
            And during that time, I was really stressed. I just gave up my
            entire career and my entire education for the hope of a company. But
            it didn’t even go viral. Like, I did all this for like 15,000 views.
            And I was really worried. Everybody in my life, including even my co
            founders, were telling me, like, hey, we should probably stop. We
            should probably shut this down.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I don’t know. There was just a voice in my head that said, like,
            this is something. This has potential. Like, I have to keep going.
            And I did keep going. And then at one point, it did go viral, like
            super viral. And everybody on tech saw it.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that point, I was safe. Virality protected me from further
            punishment from Colombia. It made the path to entrepreneurship a lot
            easier and clearer. I’ve sort of like, committed my life to building
            companies. Once I made that decision, it was very easy for me to
            decide to leave Colombia. And once I did leave Colombia, like, I
            knew I’m going to do the only thing that I can do now, which is
            build companies. I think it also helps position me. Like, I’m a very
            unique person now who got kicked out of an Ivy League. And as a
            result, there’s a lot of interest from Silicon Valley about what I’m
            going to do next.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Speed kills. Slowness kills faster</h2>
          <p>
            To me at the time, it felt like things were moving really slow. As
            soon as Interview Coder went viral, I knew that I had to capitalize
            on the moment because the attention wasn’t going to be there for
            long. The product was a product designed to die, the product to
            cheat on technical interviews. So the second companies change
            technical interviews, the product dies, meaning I have a few short
            moments before my - my spot in the limelight dies.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I thought, I have to raise a round. I have to start a bigger
            company that’s more sustainable and defensible long term. So for me,
            it felt like things were moving so slow, I had to push back my
            fundraise. Like two, I was going to fundraise two weeks earlier than
            I did. To me at the time, I felt like I was in such a time crunch
            and I had to wrap things up and do the next thing. And it felt like
            things were moving super slow, but I guess I was under the pressure
            of the situation.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Yes, parts of it were planned - the rest was reps, reps, reps</h2>
          <p>
            Yeah, I mean, we planned for me to use Interview Coder to cheat on a
            bunch of big tech interviews and get the jobs, and we thought that
            was going to be a viral moment. So in that sense, we planned it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the last three months, I’ve made probably maybe like a thousand
            tweets. And since then, I’ve figured out how to make tweets that
            will go viral, how to make tweets that will be more controversial
            and get more engagement. I think for X especially. Well, I’ve only
            really cracked X, I think, because I think people on Twitter are a
            very unique type of people. They love controversy, they love drama,
            they love attention, and they love to either dog on people or watch
            people get dogged on.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think every single time you tweet something, if you don’t think
            half the people in the world would feel very negative about this,
            then it’s probably not going to be viral as a tweet. All of your
            tweets that will, you’re planning on making go viral, they need to
            have a very strong controversial twist that makes people pause and
            be like, what the fuck? And this is not the case for Instagram,
            TikTok or LinkedIn or whatever, but it is the case for Twitter. And
            yeah, I think, I think Twitter next. The more controversial you’re
            willing to make a tweet, the better and the more viral you will go.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>What works on X, for me:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Write something that makes at least half the people mad or
                confused.
              </li>
              <li>
                Give people a clear villain or a clear rebel - let them pick a
                side.
              </li>
              <li>
                Post a lot. Like, actually a lot. A thousand reps rewires your
                brain for the platform.
              </li>
              <li>
                Be okay being the main character for a day. It burns, then it
                passes.
              </li>
              <li>
                Don’t try this exact tone on IG, TikTok, or LinkedIn. Different
                rooms, different rules.
              </li>

          <h2>Hate, love, and why none of it really matters</h2>
          <p>
            Interview Coder on Twitter was received so positively. It was just
            like this scrappy young kid who was trying to fight back against big
            industry, big tech. And everyone on Twitter was very supportive. I
            think as I got bigger and my account grew, people grew less
            supportive, which is like, to be expected. I’m generally very good
            at receiving hate and criticism. I’m a very polarizing personality
            and I do a lot of crazy stuff. Throughout my life, I’ve always had
            people, like, giving me hate. None of the negative comments really
            stood out, but I was very surprised to see how positively Interview
            Coder was received on Twitter when I first launched it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think people are often so worried that they’re going to say
            something bad online and it’s just going to get back to them and
            their reputation is over and I don’t know, like, it’s. It’s going to
            bury them. But I think in reality, all press is good press. I say a
            ton of super controversial stuff, and in every video I’m in, there’s
            like a bunch of comments saying, oh, this guy’s evil. This guy’s
            like, like this, this. And then there’s always some hate. But it’s
            like, like this stuff really doesn’t matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yeah, I mean, like, I. I’ve learned that it really doesn’t matter
            if, if. If everybody in the world just doesn’t like you. Well,
            actually, it’s. It’s done pretty much the opposite. I’ve realized
            that even if I say extremely crazy shit online, it will just make
            people more interested in me and the company, and it’ll just drive
            more downloads and conversions and get more eyeballs onto Cluely. If
            anything, I’ve learned that I need to become crazier online so that
            people will keep funneling attention towards the core product.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think there’s. It’s very, very rare that you will say something
            online that translates to something negative happening in the real
            world. Like, online is not real life. I’m a pretty chill person in
            real life, but online, I’m crazy because it gets. It gets me
            engagement and attention.

          <h2>Split the personas: the online me vs the real me</h2>
          <p>
            When you are so polarizing and controversial online, you need to
            very clearly distinguish. This is my real world life, and this is
            the online life. And in my real world life, there are very few
            people who I trust fully and who I think I love and love me. My
            parents will always be on my side, no matter what crazy shit I do
            online. And my wife and kids, they will always be on my side, no
            matter what crazy shit I do online.
          </p>
          <p>
            And I think it is very, very important to distinguish. This is my
            real life family and friends, and they love me unconditionally, and
            I love them. And everything online is just noise. Even if everyone
            online or everyone outside this box hates me, it doesn’t matter.
            Because the most important people are in this box and the people
            that I love and love me back.

          <h2>
            From Interview Coder to Cluely: the UX we didn’t know we needed
          </h2>
          <p>
            Interview Coder is a tool designed to let you cheat on technical
            interviews. But what we realized as we built Interview Coder is that
            the idea of an AI that sees your screen and hears your audio sort of
            shows itself as this translucent screen overlay. This has never
            really been attempted before. This is a completely novel user
            experience and it’s very short sighted to think that this is only
            good for cheating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately what we’re building is we’re building for a future where
            models are multimodal and the models are not there yet. And they’re
            probably not going to be there yet for another three years. Nobody’s
            really thought of what happens when chatbots are no longer relevant.
            What happens when you don’t want to prompt GPT anymore and AI just
            knows what you want? Then how will you interact with AI? Nobody’s
            really attempted this before and I think Interview Coder was the
            first proof of concept of a user experience that could work in this
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we realized that and that’s, that’s what we’re building. Cluely
            off. I mean Cluely is the new way you will use AI in, in five years,
            hopefully if we do things right, then in two years.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <p>What the translucent overlay does, in words:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Watches your screen and listens to audio context, then quietly
                aligns itself to what you’re doing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Shows up as a thin, ghosted layer - no modal windows, no
                tab-switching, no prompt boxes fighting for attention.
              </li>
              <li>
                Surfaces what matters: the next step, the edge case, the
                phrasing, the code skeleton, the summary, the counterpoint.
              </li>
              <li>
                Disappears when you don’t need it. Appears before you realize
                you do.
              </li>
              <li>Makes “AI as environment” feel normal, not flashy.</li>

          <h2>“Cheat on everything” - what that phrase actually means</h2>
          <p>
            The phrase cheat on everything is intentionally ambiguous. Like what
            is cheat on? Like I know what cheat on test means, but I don’t know
            what cheat on everything means. It’s left to be sort of confusing
            and make you sit on it and reflect for a moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you see someone using AI for everything, it makes you think
            this is unfair. They’re not supposed to be doing that, they’re
            cheating. In reality, like if you can use this for everything, like
            what does cheating on a meeting look like? That’s not really a
            thing. It’s just our gut human reaction to think this is so
            different, this is such a big advantage that it’s unfair.
          </p>
          <p>
            And what we hope to do is we hope to give everyone this advantage.
            When every single person is using AI to cheat on meetings, then it’s
            not that you’re using, you’re cheating anymore. You’re just. This is
            just how humans will operate and think in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think when you can use AI, you should use AI. If it helps you,
            then you should use it. If using a calculator will help you, then
            you should use it. If using spellcheck will help you, then you will
            use it. Eventually the spellcheck will teach you how to spell the
            right words because you’ll get used to it so much or you just won’t
            need to know how to spell anymore, you’ll just need to know what the
            word is. If you can use AI to help, then you should. And if it can
            already do the job, then you’ll never need to do the job in the
            future.

          <h2>Interviews are going to change. Maybe interviews go away</h2>
          <p>
            Assuming AI is everywhere, which it will be, all of technical
            interviews need to change. Not just in software engineering, but
            everywhere in the world. If you get asked a question and AI can
            answer the question, then you should probably get that out of your
            interview.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think interviews will be a lot more holistic and I really question
            whether we even need job interviews at all in the future. If there
            is an AI that knows everything about you, everything you’re good at,
            why do you need a one hour interview to assess anything other than
            culture fit? I already know all the work you’ve done, or at least
            the AI already knows the work you’ve done. It knows how good it is,
            it knows what skills you’re good at. And if there is a skill match,
            then AI should just be able to match you directly to the job.
            Assuming that we get along after like a 30 minute conversation, I
            really don’t know that there is a need for interviews in today’s
            age.
          </p>
          <p>
            But, but right now what we use is, it’s really just a conversation.
            We check if you’re a culture fit, we talk about past work you’ve
            done, and that’s pretty much it.

          <h2>Cluely’s mission in one sentence</h2>
          <p>
            The whole point of Cluely is to get everybody used to the fact or
            used to a life where they use AI for everything. Once everybody uses
            AI in every instance possible, there’s going to be a lot of jobs
            that get replaced and there’s going to be a lot of people who are
            able to do so much more than they previously were.
          </p>
          <p>
            If every scientist decided one day like today, I’m going to start
            using AI as much as possible too, they’ll be 100 times more
            productive. When scientists are 100 times more productive, we cure
            cancer 10 years earlier, we cure Alzheimer’s 10 years earlier,
            everyone lives to 400 years old and we’re on the next flight to
            fucking Mars in like two years, the rate of societal progression
            will just expand and exponentiate significantly. Once everyone gets
            along to the fact that we’re all using AI now, and that’s what
            Cluely hopes to achieve, is to get everybody used to, we’re all
            using AI now.

          <h2>Building the overlay: more taste than raw tech</h2>
          <p>
            I think the, the user experience. I spent a lot of time making the
            user experience very seamless. It’s less of a technical challenge, I
            think and more of a taste challenge. The, the concept of a
            translucent screen overlay, something that really has never been
            attempted before. And it’s something that, that I tried and I think
            I only got to it after like dozens of iterations of different tools.
            That would be a more seamless use of AI in your life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yeah, I think that was probably the biggest technical challenge was
            just figuring out like what exactly is the best user experience for
            someone using this tool.

          <h2>Latency, accuracy, and getting to instant</h2>
          <p>
            I mean, I mean latency, response speed and accuracy are like the two
            biggest things. This is what every model, every like OpenAI is
            working to improve latency and accuracy. There’s ways that we can
            get to a much faster response.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If we host models on our own servers, this eliminates a lot of the
              latency that comes from the load balancing and request handling
              that is just inherent in OpenAI servers. That’s probably what we
              will end up doing.
            </li>
            <li>
              There’s ways that we can cache the input and sort of like
              parameterize the input so that you get the same condensed info,
              same information, but just condensed in a smaller way. And the
              smaller the input size, the faster the time to first token.
            </li>
            <li>
              Also generally accuracy can be improved by specific system
              prompts.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We’re developing custom evals in house based on a lot of the
            analytics and usage that we’re seeing and like everything is getting
            better. Like every single day the mod of the cluely gets more
            accurate and faster. At a certain point we’re going to know exactly
            what type of responses you prefer as an individual, what sort of
            conversations that you’re in and we can use all that data to
            generate a very, very hyper specific, personalized, fine tuned model
            for you that knows that hey, I’m a media reporter, I conduct these
            sorts of interviews and I generally want these types of responses or
            the tonality of my emails is this. So I would like you to respond in
            this way and you can just get the most personalized model in the
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            And once we have that data as like a moat defending us from the
            other big tech companies, then we’ll pretty much be unstoppable,
            more so than the data. I think the user experience is just
            interesting, untapped and novel. If we’re correct about this, then
            we’ll be the first to market and there’s a huge first mover
            advantage. When you’re trying a new form of UX and as if we can
            capture the market quickly enough by going viral enough sufficiently
            then I think there will be, it will be very hard to compete with us.

          <h2>AI will change how humans think - not just how we work</h2>
          <p>
            The entire way we’re going to think will be changed. Every single
            one of my thoughts is formulated by the information I have at this
            moment. What happens when that information I have isn’t just what’s
            in my brain, but it’s everything that humanity has ever collected
            and put online, ever. What happens when AI literally helps me think
            in real time?
          </p>
          <p>
            The entire way that humans will interact with each other, with the
            world, all of our thoughts will be changed. Like, what happens when
            I know about every single post you’ve made online ever? And I use
            that to distill down into like a, like a condensed blurb of
            everything about you, ever? What does our interaction look like
            then? It’s really hard to say, but I think this is a turning point
            for humanity and it will fundamentally change the way that we think
            and the way that we behave as humans.

          <h2>If you’re not building in AI right now, what are you doing?</h2>
          <p>
            Well, if you’re not building a company in AI right now, then you’re
            probably not doing the right thing. AI just enables you to build
            such cool stuff and it’s such a new technology that even if you’re
            19 and you’ve been playing with it for two months, you are one of
            the brightest minds. You are one of the pioneers of the field.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s not like biology, where if you haven’t studied for 10, 20 years
            and you don’t, then you’re not an expert in biology. You can study
            AI for two months and you’ll be an expert in AI. This technology is
            so gigantic and it’s so new that you can be really, really young and
            you can, you can know it more deeply than anyone else, and you’ll
            have the opportunity to build like a billion, $10 billion company
            out of it.

          <h2>My only advice: take bigger risks</h2>
          <p>
            I would say take bigger risks. This is the only advice I have for
            anyone, really. You are smart enough, you’re capable enough, you’re
            hardworking enough. Just take bigger risks. If you take bigger risks
            and force yourself into positions where you have to make it, you’ll
            find that you’re a lot more hardworking than you thought you were.
            And you’ll also find that life gets a lot more interesting.
          </p>
          <p>
            And very often the downside of risk is much smaller than you think.
            And the upside of risk is much bigger than you think. I wasn’t
            really like this five months ago. I mean, literally, like, like half
            a year ago, I was thinking I would just want to get a job at a big
            tech company. That’s all I want to do. And it wasn’t until very
            recently that I thought, like, oh, I actually want to build
            companies and go all in on this.
          </p>
          <h3>How risks stack - from tiny to “post the confidential PDF”</h3>
          <p>
            Taking risks, initially it means being willing to get rid of the
            constructs and limiting beliefs in your mind that make you think,
            hey, when I graduate, I have to be an engineer, lawyer, doctor or
            whatever. Just being willing to see what would happen if you didn’t
            do it. Every risk starts very small right now.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The first risk I took was, hey, what if I. What if I built this
              tool and told nobody about it?
            </li>
            <li>
              Then the next risk I took was, what if I posted online but made it
              free and didn’t really associate with it so that people, more
              people would see it?
            </li>
            <li>
              And eventually the risk just snowballed and snowballed. Until now
              I’m like fully posting whatever confidential document Columbia
              University gives me because, like, I don’t care. Like, the risk is
              not. It’s not that much of a risk anymore. And I’ve grown used to
              it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>So grow used to taking bigger risks.</p>

          <h2>Privilege, perspective, and why I don’t play the victim</h2>
          <p>
            I feel like my life is very easy. My life has been very easy. I
            mean, my mom, I’ve got loving parents. My mom, she made me study
            even when I didn’t want to. She would just say, well, you should go
            study. So I studied and as a result, I did well in school and I hung
            out with smart kids and they helped me do better in life. Like, I
            have two amazing, great parents and I come from a great family. I
            don’t really feel like my life has been all that challenging.
          </p>
          <p>
            Getting kicked out of Columbia University, it’s not that challenging
            when you’re out there building companies and I was going to drop out
            anyways, getting rescinded from Harvard. This is also not that
            challenging when you have a loving family at home. There’s kids like
            out there who are starving in like Uganda. And like, my life is not
            that hard really. A lot of everything that you should think is you
            should just try and think more positively about life and be more
            optimistic about things.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is very rare that you’re going to be in America, you’re going to
            have the opportunity to go to college and you’re really in like an
            actually challenging situation. In reality, we are in the most
            interesting time in history. If you live in America and you’re not
            like in poverty and your parents aren’t crackheads, you have the
            opportunity to make billions of dollars and make generational wealth
            and do the most interesting thing ever. There’s very few challenging
            situations that are so challenging that you’re just like limited
            right now. Anybody can do anything. And you should just try and take
            risks and be bold because you’re very privileged right now to be
            living in this world.

          <h2>What success looks like to me</h2>
          <p>
            Success is having a wife, having 12 kids, and having people remember
            me. I think Steve Jobs and Elon Musk are very cool in that everyone
            has a strong opinion about them, whether it’s good or bad. Everyone
            has something to say about Elon Musk and I think that’s really cool.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re all going to die eventually and nobody’s going to remember us
            in a thousand years. I might as well be remembered as strongly as
            possible for the time that I’m here.

          <h2>The real unlock: confidence</h2>
          <p>
            I think the biggest thing is confidence. Like truly, you hear all
            the time that the people that build big companies are not geniuses.
            They’re not smarter than you. They’re just, they take more risks
            than you and they’re hard work, harder workers than you. And I think
            this is generally true.
          </p>
          <p>
            Five months ago I was just some random student at some random school
            and I didn’t really have anything going for me. And now I just
            raised $5 million and I’m in this giant office and I’m building a
            company that I hope will change the world one day. And very little
            has changed about me except the fact that I took a risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even moving forward, if I do end up becoming like the next
            trillionaire, like as big as Mark Zuckerberg, there will be nothing
            about me that changed. It’ll just be a series of well calculated
            risks that I took that will lead me there. And I think the gap
            between Mark Zuckerberg and your average human, it’s really not that
            big. And if you just have the confidence to take bigger risks, then
            very often you will win.

          <h2>Where we are right now</h2>
          <p>
            We launched Cluely - Cluely - about a month ago. We’re closing in on
            $5 million in ARR. We just closed a $5.3 million seed round led by
            Abstract Ventures and Suse Ventures. Those numbers matter, but not
            because they’re trophies. They matter because they buy time. Time to
            turn a viral hack into a durable product. Time to learn what the
            overlay needs to feel like in a world where AI will see, hear, and
            think alongside you. Time to make “cheat on everything” stop
            sounding dirty and start sounding normal.
          </p>
        </section>

        <h2>Closing thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          I built a tool that let me cheat interviews, recorded myself using it
          on an Amazon interview, posted it, got kicked out of Columbia
          University, got yelled at online, got loved online, went viral, raised
          money, and doubled down on building what I think is the next interface
          for human-Computer thinking. That’s the path so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s the promise I’m betting my life on: in a few years you won’t
          talk to chatbots. You won’t “prompt.” You’ll work, and AI will quietly
          work with you - seeing your screen, hearing your context, surfacing
          exactly what you need as a translucent layer that feels like part of
          your mind. If that sounds like cheating, good. The future always feels
          like cheating right before it becomes normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          So if you’re young, or old, or anywhere in between - take bigger
          risks. Post the thing. Build the thing. Say the thing. Separate your
          online character from your real life. Keep your box of real people
          close. And then run straight into the craziest, most interesting time
          to be alive with your eyes open and your hands on the keyboard.
