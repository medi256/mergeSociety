        <p>
          Five days ago I had an idea for a mobile app. Yesterday it made its
          first dollar. From idea to build to live on the App Store within five
          days - and it already brought in money. Today I want to walk you
          through exactly how I did it, what worked, what I got lucky with, and
          how I’m going to push it to the next level so it’s not just a one-time
          lucky viral post. I’ll show you my launch, the numbers, the code
          process, the tools I used, my marketing plan, and how you might do
          something similar even if you don’t move as fast as I did.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>The 5-Day Sprint and That First Sale</h2>
          <p>
            Let’s set the stage. Five days ago I sketched an idea for a simple
            couples app - something I actually wanted for me and my fiance. I
            started last Wednesday. I worked heads down for three days, six to
            eight hours a day, got a build I felt good about, and pushed it
            through review. Yesterday the app made its first dollar. That was
            the moment. You know that feeling when a thing you made turns into a
            little business in real time. It never gets old.
          </p>
          <p>
            Was part of this luck? Yeah, for sure. I got lucky on timing and on
            a couple posts performing well. But there’s a plan behind it. I
            don’t want a one-hit spike. I want something that keeps growing,
            keeps converting, and finds the people it’s actually meant for. So
            this is both a story and a playbook.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>
            The Launch Tweet: Why Twitter Took Off Even Though It’s Not My
            Target Audience
          </h2>
          <p>
            First things first, here’s how the launch went down. I posted my
            launch on Twitter. Not because Twitter is where my ideal couples
            audience hangs out - it’s not. Couples content lives way more on
            Instagram and TikTok. But I’ve been building in public for a while,
            and I’ve got a decent following there. So I shared what I was
            building like I always do.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I didn’t expect: the launch tweet took off. It hit around half
            a million views, pulled in about a thousand likes, and sparked a
            bunch of replies. The tweet itself was basically me doing what I do:
            share the thing I made, show the UI, mention the features, talk
            about the launch, and most importantly, show the early results with
            real numbers. People love that behind-the-scenes builder energy.
            It’s genuine, it’s specific, and it’s not fluff.
          </p>
          <aside>
            <h3>What the Tweet Looked Like</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A clean app preview image like the one you see on the App Store
                listing, with a short caption.
              </li>
              <li>
                Quick bullet points on the features: love letters, check-ins,
                and widgets you can put on your home screen.
              </li>
              <li>
                A short note on the build: started last Wednesday, done in about
                three days.
              </li>
              <li>
                Then the kicker - early results from the first few hours live.
                Numbers make people stop scrolling.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </aside>
          <p>
            That mix - honest build story plus real data - is what I think
            pushed it past my usual reach. Even though Twitter isn’t where
            couples go to find couple apps, builders and tech folks loved the
            story and boosted it. That mattered in the first few hours.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>
            What the App Is: A Simple Couples App With Widgets, Love Letters,
            and Check-ins
          </h2>
          <p>
            I made this for me and my fiance first. That’s important. When you
            build for yourself, you get fast clarity on what matters and what
            doesn’t. It’s a couples app with a few core things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Love letters - you send sweet notes to your partner inside the
              app.
            </li>
            <li>
              Widgets - you can set your partner’s latest love letter as a
              widget on your home screen so it shows up every time you open your
              phone.
            </li>
            <li>
              Check-ins - short guided questions to help you check in with each
              other consistently.
            </li>
            <li>
              Other small touches - like prompts, reminders, and a light playful
              vibe that makes it feel fun, not heavy.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If we were watching this as a video, this is where I’d show the App
            Store screenshots. So picture this: minimal UI, soft colors, clean
            typography, and a big, warm card that displays a love note. Tap into
            it and you can write your own letter, attach a doodle, or set it as
            a widget. There’s an area for check-ins, with a weekly cadence you
            can turn on so you don’t forget. Simple. Deliberate. Not bloated.
          </p>

          <h2>The First 3 Hours Live: Real Numbers</h2>
          <p>
            In the first three hours on the App Store, here’s what happened:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>100 downloads.</li>
            <li>11 trials started.</li>
            <li>Someone bought a yearly sub, which was $21 in profit.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That early signal was pretty interesting. Not world-changing, but
            when something new starts converting at all, it’s exciting.
            Especially when it’s coming from a channel that isn’t even your
            target audience.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>The Live Snapshot: Revenue, Trials, and Cancellations</h2>
          <p>
            Here’s where we’re at right now. I literally refreshed while writing
            this:
          </p>
          <aside>
            <h3>Current Snapshot</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>$42 in proceeds.</li>
              <li>460 downloads.</li>
              <li>
                36 conversions total:
                <ul>
                  <li>2 yearly subscriptions.</li>
                  <li>34 trial starts.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Trial cancellations: around 50% or more so far, so maybe ~15
                active trials at best.
              </li>
              <li>Trial product: weekly plan at 4.99 USD per week.</li>
            </ul>
          </aside>
          <p>
            That cancellation rate is normal for early days while pricing, value
            messaging, and onboarding are still raw. I’m not sweating it. The
            key is to keep improving the content and the flow so the right
            people stick. Plus, this traffic is coming almost entirely from
            Twitter - not exactly the couples app crowd. So it’s actually a good
            sign that people are even trying it.

          <h2>Traffic Reality Check: Most Of This Came From Twitter</h2>
          <p>
            All the numbers you’re seeing here are basically from those Twitter
            posts where I build in public. That’s cool, and it helped kick
            things off, but I don’t think it’s replicable for everyone,
            especially if you don’t have a following yet. So I don’t want you to
            think the only way to launch is to get lucky with a post. That’s not
            sustainable.
          </p>
          <p>
            The good news: I do have a system I’ve used before to grow apps to
            100,000+ downloads. It’s repeatable. It’s content-driven. And it’s
            focused on finding a content format that brings in downloads, then
            scaling it. I’ll show you exactly what I mean, with real examples,
            in a bit.

          <h2>
            How I Built It: Xcode, Swift, Claude in Cursor, and Zero Lines Typed
            by Hand
          </h2>
          <p>
            Let’s talk about the build. I used Xcode and wrote the app in Swift.
            If you don’t have a Mac, you can use Expo in React Native - I’ve
            built three other apps with that framework. You don’t need a Mac for
            that. But if you’re targeting iOS, you’ll still want a physical
            iPhone to test on. The same goes for Android if you plan to ship
            there.
          </p>
          <p>
            For this app, I went native with Swift. And here’s the part people
            ask about: I didn’t type a single line of code by hand. I opened
            Cursor, used Claude Code inside Cursor, and asked it to build
            components and screens for me. To be super clear, when I say “I
            didn’t use Cursor,” what I mean is I didn’t lean on special
            Cursor-only features - I basically used it as my editor with Claude
            as my coding buddy. The project directory sat on the left. I gave
            Claude instructions on the right. It generated code, I ran it in
            Xcode, and we iterated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Were there problems? Of course. I ran into issues, but nothing I
            couldn’t search up or ask Claude about. Claude was very good at
            crafting the UI and getting the general layout and functionality
            right on the first try. The tweaks took longer because each change
            meant rebuilding the project in Xcode. There’s a preview function
            somewhere, but I don’t know how to use it, so I just rebuilt.
            Widgets were especially buggy to add at first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Total build time: about three days at six to eight hours per day. I
            double-checked all the Firebase security rules myself. I made sure
            ownership was correctly enforced, private data stayed private, and
            reads and writes were scoped to the right users. Boring, but
            necessary. One of those things you only notice when you don’t do it
            and something breaks in prod.
          </p>

          <h2>What I’m Doing on TikTok Right Now</h2>
          <p>
            While Xcode was building, I started working on TikTok. My fiance has
            a TikTok account, so we posted there first. She made a TikTok about
            the app. I’m going to try to get her to make a few more, because a
            couples app hits better when it’s coming from, you know, an actual
            couple. It feels real and relatable.
          </p>
          <p>I also posted a few videos myself. Here’s what I’m seeing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Direct ads get ignored. If the video screams “this is an ad,”
              people swipe. They don’t connect with it emotionally, so it dies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Content that doesn’t mention the app sometimes feels cleaner, but
              if it isn’t engineered for virality, it won’t move. These didn’t
              perform great either.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I’m in test mode. I’m iterating on formats until something hits.
            That pipeline of testing, learning, and iterating is how I’ve grown
            before, so I’m doing it again here.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Content Format That Took My Other App to 100K+ Downloads</h2>
          <p>
            Let me show you what I mean by “find a format that works.” For my
            other app, Curiosityquench, one content format delivered a massive
            chunk of the growth. I’m talking millions of views across a bunch of
            posts and roughly 30,000 to 50,000 downloads traced back to that
            format alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            What did the format look like? Simple, snackable videos with a
            punchy hook and a payoff. They were easy to repeat, easy to remix,
            and easy to consume. At the end, the call to action was just in the
            caption. That meant conversion wasn’t insane, but because the
            content traveled so far, the top-of-funnel was huge and it still
            moved real numbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s the plan with this couples app too. I’m not going to rely on
            Twitter traffic. I’m going to test until I find a format that gets
            consistent views and still converts, then I’ll build a repeatable
            pipeline around it.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>How I’ll Scale: Automating Posts with Postbridge</h2>
          <p>
            Once I lock a content format that actually converts to downloads
            (and ideally paid ones), I’ll scale by volume and consistency. That
            means making a batch of videos in that format and posting them every
            day or twice a day across TikTok, Instagram, and anywhere else that
            fits. I’ll use Postbridge for that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Postbridge is an app I built to help me scale my mobile apps. It
            automates posting across platforms so I don’t waste hours doing it
            manually. If you’ve followed me for a while, you’ve probably seen
            the format I used a long time ago that worked well - I posted it a
            lot. Over time it stopped hitting, but that’s because I didn’t
            iterate. Formats get milked dry. The trick is to keep evolving the
            format after you find initial traction, not just repeat the same
            thing forever.
          </p>
          <p>So the process looks like this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Test like crazy until one format clearly works.</li>
            <li>Iterate that format so it keeps performing week after week.</li>
            <li>
              Turn up the volume and automate posting with Postbridge, because I
              don’t have all day to do it manually.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Demo Time: What the App Looks Like and How It Works</h2>
          <p>
            Let’s walk through the app, since the build is ready. Picture
            opening it to a clean, cozy home screen. At the center is your Love
            Box - a space where affections, love letters, and notes from your
            partner live. You tap into it and see a list of notes, each with a
            timestamp and a little preview of the message.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can compose a new love letter with text, and if you’ve got
            premium, you can add doodles. Right now in the simulator I can’t add
            a doodle since I’m not logged into the right account with premium
            enabled, but in the real app you’d see a little drawing canvas. It
            lets you sketch a heart, write a quick “thinking of you,” or draw
            something silly only your partner would get.
          </p>
          <p>
            Widgets are a big part of the experience. You can set your partner’s
            latest love letter as a widget, so it shows right on the home screen
            of your phone. Imagine unlocking your phone and seeing a
            handwritten-style note from your person. Inside the app, there’s a
            widget settings area where you can pick which note to feature, and
            you can edit from there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Check-ins live in their own tab. These are short, guided prompts
            like “What made you smile this week?” or “Anything on your mind we
            should talk about?” You can set weekly reminders so you don’t
            forget. It’s not meant to feel like homework. It’s just a quick way
            to stay in sync.
          </p>
          <p>
            Claude built most of this shockingly easily. I gave it a lot of
            direction, sure, but the UI came together fast and it looks clean.
            Functionally, it’s solid. There are always bugs - especially around
            security rules, edge cases in data sync, and certain UI elements
            that don’t look great in specific scenarios - but nothing wild.
            That’s the normal polish phase of making an app feel good.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, this took about three days of focused work, six to eight
            hours each day. The app isn’t super complex. It’s just useful and
            fun if you have a partner. That’s the point.

          <h2>Want to Try This Yourself? Here’s Exactly What I Did</h2>
          <p>
            If you want to build an app like this, here’s the exact path I took:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Spin up a new Xcode project in Swift. Even if you plan to lean on
              an AI coding buddy, start with a clean base so the structure is
              your own.
            </li>
            <li>
              Open the project in Cursor with Claude Code enabled. I put the
              project directory on the left and gave Claude specific tasks on
              the right: build a screen, wire a view, create a model, add a
              widget, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Work in test mode first. I started on a test bundle, got the flows
              working, then asked Claude to help me migrate from test to
              production.
            </li>
            <li>
              Let Claude outline the production checklist. It gave me a bunch of
              steps - provisioning profiles, bundle IDs, entitlement setups, and
              other small details that always eat time on iOS.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lock down Firebase security rules. I personally verified that
              reads and writes are scoped correctly, only owners can access
              their data, and no public leaks exist. It’s boring, but please
              don’t skip this.
            </li>
            <li>
              Expect App Review drama. You might get rejected if your app
              screens aren’t done, or if you’re missing a privacy policy, terms
              of service, or accurate metadata. There are a million ways to get
              rejected. I got lucky and passed on the first try, but I’ve
              shipped enough apps to know this is not guaranteed.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you already have an app and you’re trying to grow it, check my
            pinned tweet on Twitter. I’ll link it there. It’s a detailed outline
            of how I find formats that actually grow consumer mobile apps. Heads
            up: this is for consumer apps. It doesn’t really apply to B2B.
            Different game.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Pricing, Trials, and What I’m Watching</h2>
          <p>
            Trials right now are weekly at 4.99 USD. Two people picked up yearly
            subs already. A bunch of trial starts canceled - maybe 50% or more
            so far - which is totally normal while I tune the onboarding and the
            way the value is presented. I care less about the cancel rate today
            and more about finding the right traffic and the right content
            format that gets the right people through the door.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also worth repeating: these results are coming from Twitter, not
            TikTok or Instagram. That’s not the true audience for a couples app.
            So I’m excited to see what happens when I crack the content that
            actually belongs on the more relationship-focused platforms.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Why I’m Doing This: A Live Case Study for Postbridge</h2>
          <p>
            Part of why I’m sharing all of this is because I want this to be a
            public case study for Postbridge. If I can’t grow my own mobile app
            using the system I built, why would I expect to help other people
            grow? This is my test. Find the format, iterate it, and then scale
            it with a tool designed for exactly that.
          </p>
          <p>
            So yeah, it’s kind of wild that we’re already at 450+ downloads and
            a bunch of trials, mostly from an audience that wasn’t the plan. But
            that’s what’s fun about building in public. You get signal fast, and
            then you go where the signal is strongest.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>What’s Next</h2>
          <p>Immediate next steps for me:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Keep testing TikTok formats until something clearly outperforms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Tune onboarding and paywalls so trials convert better and
              cancellations drop.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add small UX polish and squash edge-case bugs Claude can fix
              quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once a format hits, spin up a content engine and scale posting
              with Postbridge daily.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h2>Wrap-Up</h2>
          <p>
            Five days from idea to first dollar. A couples app built for me and
            my fiance, shipped with Swift in Xcode, and coded with Claude in
            Cursor while I typed basically nothing by hand. A launch tweet that
            went way bigger than I expected. Real numbers in the first few
            hours. Real revenue on day one. And a clear plan to grow without
            relying on luck.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you want to try this, you can. Use Claude or Cursor, start a
            clean Xcode project, get a basic build working in test mode, then
            promote it to production, be ready for App Review, and lock down
            your Firebase security rules. When it comes to growth, don’t wait
            for lightning to strike. Hunt for a format, iterate it until it
            works, and then scale it with a system you can run every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks for reading. Have a good day. See you in the next one. Peace.
