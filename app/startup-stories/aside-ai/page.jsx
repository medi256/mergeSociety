        <p>
          Yes, you read that right. Cheating is legal in sales calls. I am not
          talking about lying. I am talking about using live, real-time help
          that makes you sharper, faster, and way more confident when the
          conversation gets technical or competitive. That is exactly what{" "}
          <Link href="https://asidehq.com">Aside AI</Link> does. It sits in your
          calls, listens, and feeds you what to say, when to say it, and how to
          nail the story every single time.

          <h2>Real-Time Suggestions While You Are Selling</h2>
          <p>
            A site gives real time suggestion during your sales calls. That is
            the whole idea. You are not pausing. You are not scrambling. You are
            not stalling for time. You keep the flow, keep the energy, and keep
            the trust, while an on-call brain hands you the right answer at the
            right second.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let me paint the moment. You are mid-demo. The prospect is vibing.
            Then they throw a curveball that is both fair and scary. It is a
            technical question that is not in your quick spiel. Your brain
            races. Your notes are not helping. Your product doc is 40 tabs away.
            This is where most calls go off script.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>Handling Hard Technical Questions Without Breaking Momentum</h2>
          <h3>The Salesforce Pipeline API Question</h3>
          <p>
            When a prospect draws a hard technical question - how do you
            integrate with the Salesforce Pipeline API? - you feel it. That is
            not small talk. That is not a generic feature tick box. That is a
            deep integration question that usually requires real knowledge about
            APIs, endpoints, auth, objects, and how your data model meshes with
            Salesforce. If you do not know it cold, you risk fumbling the answer
            or promising something you cannot deliver.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have been in sales long enough, you have lived this scene.
            The buyer is smart and precise. They care about workflows, security,
            and what will break. They want to know if you write back to
            opportunities, how you handle pipeline stages, whether you respect
            field-level security, and if the integration needs custom Apex. That
            is not something you wing.
          </p>

          <h3>Before Aside AI: The Awkward Stall</h3>
          <p>
            Before site you say let me tweak my team and get back to you. You
            try to keep it cool. You say you will talk to your SE. You will ping
            your PM. You will circle with engineering and email them later. You
            mean well, but the moment is gone. The energy drops. The buyer hears
            a maybe. The deal loses tiny bits of heat, and sometimes that is
            enough to drift into no decision.
          </p>

          <h2>Now You Click The Button - And You Have The Answer</h2>
          <p>
            Now you just click the button. No drama. No scramble. One click and
            Aside AI pulls the exact context you need. It is like having your
            product team in your ear, on-call, always awake, always ready with
            the crisp version of the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Actually, we will roll out an integration next week. That is the
            line that appears, perfectly tailored to the question, with the
            nuance you need. If the integration is shipping, it says so. If it
            is in beta, it says that. If there is a workaround today and a
            native integration on the roadmap, it lays that out clearly so you
            set the right expectation and still keep the momentum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh wow. Okay, that is great. You will hear that more than you
            expect. Because when you deliver a strong, specific answer inside
            the call window, trust spikes. The buyer feels like they are talking
            to someone who knows, not someone who will go ask someone else.
          </p>

          <h2>Push Answers Straight From Product Knowledge And Your Threads</h2>
          <p>
            Aside, push the answer straight from your product and select thread.
            Here is what that looks like in plain words. You click. A small
            panel slides up with a clean answer pulled from your product docs,
            your internal knowledge base, and the exact Slack thread where your
            PM broke down the Salesforce Pipeline API plan last Friday. You can
            paste it verbatim or use the short talk track version that reads
            well out loud.
          </p>
          <p>
            No need to ping your engine. Translation: you do not need to bug
            engineering in the middle of their focus block. No Slack. No frantic
            DMs. No context switching. The answer lands on your screen already
            vetted, with the nuance and language your company uses publicly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The answer lands in 8, 10 seconds. Not minutes. Not end of day.
            Think about what that feels like in a live call. You ask for it. You
            breathe. You listen to the prospect. And right as you jump in, the
            exact reply is sitting there. You sound calm. You sound certain. You
            sound like a pro.

          <h2>Then Comes The Classic Question You Heard A Hundred Times</h2>
          <p>
            Then comes with the classic question you heard a hundred times. If
            you sell in this category, you know it. Here it is, word for word.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>How is this different from Gong or Fireflies?</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            This is the moment when average reps improvise and great reps
            deliver a tight, consistent, on-brand breakdown. Consistency
            matters. If 10 reps answer 10 different ways, you confuse the
            market. The story has to land the same way, every time, with room
            for style but zero room for confusion.

          <h2>
            Aside AI Recognizes The Question And Surfaces A Live Suggestion Card
          </h2>
          <p>
            Aside AI recognizes instantly and surfaced a live suggestion card so
            every RAM nails the same story every time. The system listens to the
            call in real time, picks up the intent of the question, and pops a
            card that says exactly how you are different from Gong or Fireflies.
            It gives you the high-level framing, the three-point contrast, and
            the one-liner that sticks. You are not guessing. You are delivering
            the message the way your team agreed to deliver it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quick note on the term. If I say RAM, I mean rep. Call it account
            executive, call it seller. The point is the same. Every rep gets the
            same high-signal support so the customer hears the same clear story
            no matter who is in the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            Picture the UI. A small, clean card slides into the corner of your
            screen. Title up top. Three bullets in the middle with the bolded
            contrasts the market cares about. An optional detail toggle if the
            buyer wants to go deeper on privacy or data handling. You scan in a
            heartbeat and speak naturally. It feels like you practiced this 20
            times, even if it is your first week on the team.

          <h2>Missed A Pain Point? Get A Live Nudge To Dig Deeper</h2>
          <p>
            When you miss a prospect's pain point, Aside AI flags you live and
            nudges you on what to dig into next. This is not a slap on the
            wrist. It is a friendly tap. You hear the buyer say, pipeline
            accuracy has been messy this quarter, and you move on too fast. AI
            Aside catches that and drops a nudge like, ask how they measure
            accuracy or dig into the revenue impact of forecast slippage.
          </p>
          <p>In practice, you might see prompts like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Ask about their current Salesforce objects and who edits stages.
            </li>
            <li>Clarify if they need write-back or read-only integration.</li>
            <li>Probe the approval flow for deal stage changes.</li>
            <li>
              Check security preferences: OAuth, SSO, field-level security.
            </li>
            <li>
              Quantify pain: how often do API syncs fail and what breaks when
              they do.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These nudges turn soft signals into hard discovery. You go from
            surface level to substance without losing the natural flow of the
            conversation.

          <h2>Turn Repeated Misses Into A Playbook</h2>
          <p>
            If your team keeps missing a question, turn into a playbook. That is
            the move. You spot patterns across calls. Same objection. Same
            technical curveball. Same competitor angle. Instead of coaching it 1
            by 1 forever, you hit Create Playbook, add the talk track, add the
            proof points, and set the trigger so it appears when that question
            shows up again.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now every rep benefits the next time. New hire or veteran, everyone
            gets the sharpened version. The playbook grows on real calls, not
            theory. It captures what lands and what does not. Over time you end
            up with a living system that reflects your market, your product, and
            your voice.

          <h2>After The Call: Coaching That Actually Changes Behavior</h2>
          <p>
            After the call, Aside AI gives coaching feedback on what worked and
            and what did not. You get specifics, not vague platitudes. It
            highlights moments where you handled the objection perfectly. It
            circles spots where you talked over the buyer or missed a follow up.
            It shows the timeline so you can replay the exact 12 seconds that
            mattered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us say remembers it so you never repeat the mistake. Read that
            again. The system does not just score you. It remembers what you
            tend to miss and builds you a personal improvement track. If you
            keep skipping next steps, it will remind you in the next call at the
            right moment. If you rush discovery, it will slow you down with a
            prompt to ask one more why.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every miss becomes a weapon. That is the mindset. You are not afraid
            to get it wrong because wrong turns into a lesson that the system
            bakes into your future calls. Your team gets compounding gains. Your
            ramp time shrinks. Your win rate ticks up. Not magic. Just reps
            getting the right help at the right time.

          <h2>Our Vision: Close The Knowledge Gap In Sales</h2>
          <p>
            Our vision is to close the knowledge gap as sales. There is always a
            gap. Products move fast. Roadmaps shift weekly. Docs change.
            Security postures evolve. New competitors pop up with a cool feature
            video on Monday and your buyer asks about it on Tuesday.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let AI handle the rational work while human build relationships.
            Humans are incredible at empathy, trust, humor, and reading the
            room. AI is incredible at recall, pattern matching, and instant
            retrieval. Put those together and you get calls where the facts are
            always right and the vibe is always human. That is the future we are
            betting on. Not robots replacing reps. Reps superpowered by a calm,
            quiet, insanely smart copilot.

            card pop up. Feel the difference when you never have to say let me
            tweak my team and get back to you.

          <p>
            The moment you see an answer land in 8 to 10 seconds, you will get
            it. The moment a nudge helps you dig one level deeper on pain, you
            will get it. The moment your team turns one repeated miss into a
            clean playbook, you will really get it. That is the point. Every
            rep, same story, stronger outcomes.
