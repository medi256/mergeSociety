        </h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Interviewer:</strong> Satya Nadella, thank you so much for
          joining us. I want to respect your time, so let’s jump straight in.
          The Internet has been buzzing with talk that “Satya Nadella said SaaS
          is dead.” We both know that’s not quite what you said—nuance can get
          lost online. Can you explain how you see the evolution from SaaS to
          agents?
        </p>

        <h2>The Next Platform Shift: From Relational Databases to AI Agents</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Satya Nadella:</strong> Absolutely. Whenever there’s a real
          platform shift, the architecture of core applications changes
          radically. If we think back to the birth of the relational database,
          it marked the first time we separated the data tier from the
          application itself. Before that, databases—ISAM databases, for
          example—were tightly baked into the application logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The introduction of relational algebra, SQL, and the ability to build
          business logic on top of structured data unlocked a new era.
          Subsequent platform shifts, like the Web, prompted us to rethink
          everything again—introducing concepts like n-tier application
          architecture and new strategies for organizing business logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe we are on the cusp of another transformation of equal or
          greater magnitude. This time, it centers on agents—AI-powered actors
          that aren’t limited to a single SaaS application or dataset. Instead,
          agents can operate across many tools and data pools. They’re
          orchestrating logic that can span multiple SaaS APIs, combining
          information and functionality from a range of sources into a single,
          intelligent workflow.
        </p>

        <h2>Agents in Action: Rethinking Workflows</h2>
        <p>
          To illustrate: today, most SaaS applications function as CRUD (create,
          read, update, delete) databases adorned with business logic. The new
          wave of agentic systems orchestrates and manages those CRUD
          operations, but from outside the boundaries of any individual app.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, in my own workflow, I might use Copilot to carry out a
          task—say, managing sales data. Instead of logging into a CRM, I simply
          prompt Copilot, which retrieves data from Dynamics CRM, grabs related
          documents from Office365, collates everything into a shareable page,
          and streamlines my collaboration. The entire workflow, from
          data-gathering to sharing, is managed by a swarm of AI agents
          coordinating across multiple platforms. Previously, people almost
          never accessed CRM databases directly; now, thanks to agentic
          integration, I find myself querying CRM data daily because it's so
          accessible.
        </p>

        <h3>Hiring for the Future: People Plus Agents</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Interviewer:</strong> Does this mean, in the future, we’ll be
          hiring people along with their customized workflows—almost like hiring
          someone with a set of digital assistants in tow?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Satya:</strong> Exactly! Imagine it as a “basket of agents”
          you bring with you, much as a data analyst comes equipped with
          favorite spreadsheets and toolkits. Building and deploying agents will
          become as routine as making documents or spreadsheets. I see this
          already—my SharePoint leadership team space is filled with
          mission-critical documents, so I use a SharePoint agent to access that
          information seamlessly. It feels completely natural now to have
          context-aware agents at your fingertips, rather than having to dig
          through segregated apps.
        </p>

        <h2>India’s Opportunity in an Era of Commoditized AI</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Interviewer:</strong> How can India stay competitive as this
          landscape evolves? At first, the excitement was about building
          foundational AI models like the West, but those are already becoming
          commoditized. With the real advantage moving to continual
          breakthroughs, what's defensible for India in this new wave?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Satya:</strong> That question isn’t just about India; it
          applies globally. In tech, there’s scant long-term “franchise
          value”—even moats are ephemeral. True competitive advantage comes from
          continually moving up the value chain: you commoditize what’s
          yesterday’s high-value, and climb toward tomorrow’s.
        </p>
        <p>
          India holds tremendous promise. The vast developer pool,
          entrepreneurial energy, and unique application spaces—consider the
          novel models emerging in quick commerce—provide a fertile ground for
          AI innovation. Companies here can embrace agentic paradigms,
          integrating agents as first-class citizens in their offerings (perhaps
          directly with Copilot), even reimagining business models around these
          capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a significant opportunity and a potential attack vector
          against any established SaaS incumbent. Even in large language models,
          the design space is huge: distribution models like Foundry enable
          industry-specific, purpose-built foundational models. There’s space
          for specialized LLMs optimized for different industries, sciences, or
          operational factors like cost and latency. It won’t be “one model to
          rule them all”—there are layers upon layers of innovation available.
        </p>

        <h2>
          If Satya Were 25: Navigating the Ambiguity of a Fast-Moving World
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Interviewer:</strong> Let’s put you in the shoes of a
          25-year-old engineer in India, watching all these rapid advances and
          feeling both the excitement and the uncertainty. How would you
          position yourself? How would you upskill?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Satya:</strong> That’s an important question. Navigating the
          pace and magnitude of today’s innovation requires what I call
          “sampling with agility.” At Microsoft, our guiding philosophy is to
          stay on the innovation frontier and be ready to jump when the next
          breakthrough emerges. You need to operate in multiple gears: always
          watching for new possibilities enabled by emerging technology and
          enhancing what you’ve built previously, optimizing for cost, latency,
          and real-world deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s more than just experimentation—it’s about working both in the
          present and the future. For instance, with AI, the performance metrics
          change staggering quickly, almost doubling every three or six months,
          unlike anything we’ve seen before (think Moore’s Law on overdrive).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Interviewer:</strong> Let me share a personal anecdote. I
          recently tested out Trellis, an impressive text-to-3D model system,
          and it ran locally on my computer. The progress amazed me! If this is
          the “GPT-3.5” of 3D modeling, imagine where it’ll be in two years.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Satya:</strong> That’s a great example, and there are more.
          What excites me most is how AI model architectures will enable
          breakthroughs in science. Consider chemistry: AI models now let us
          design new materials at the molecular level. When we ask how to build
          more sustainable data centers, it always comes down to advances in
          novel materials—steel, semiconductors, etc.—and AI is accelerating
          discoveries there. Biology is even more challenging—but also more
          promising. We’re developing AI models that don’t just predict protein
          structures but model the dynamic movements of molecules, a
          breakthrough for fields like drug discovery.

          The next giant leap may well be the convergence of AI and quantum
          computing for science, where fields like chemistry and biology are
          truly “computed” from the ground up.

        <h2>
          The Fast-forward Problem: Don’t Judge Today’s AI by Yesterday’s Models
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Interviewer:</strong> A final question. As these models
          improve every three or four months, I notice a problem with legacy
          businesses. People try a new AI model, find it average or prone to
          hallucinations, and then never return. How do you advise leaders to
          keep up?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Satya:</strong> That’s an important—and common—mistake.
          Business strategy is path-dependent; if you delay adopting, you miss
          vital “shots on goal.” You can’t just observe AI from the sidelines.
          Like fitness, you don’t get in shape watching others go to the gym:
          you have to show up, experiment, and iterate.
        </p>
        <p>
          My advice: sample the best available models regularly, identify
          ambitious yet practical scenarios for deployment, and scale what
          works. Economic considerations and specifics of your use case matter,
          of course, but persistent engagement is key.
        </p>
        <p>
          For specific concerns like hallucinations, there are myriad mitigation
          strategies—such as “grounding” AI responses in verified data—or, if
          needed, bypass large language models altogether in favor of
          traditional machine learning where error tolerance is exceptionally
          low. Ultimately, it’s about knowing your error bands and matching
          technology to your risk profile.

        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          This wide-ranging conversation with Satya Nadella revealed the deep
          undercurrents shaping the future of enterprise technology—from SaaS to
          swarms of intelligent agents, from globally competitive AI ecosystems
          to the foundational role of science and quantum computing in shaping
          tomorrow’s breakthroughs. The greatest takeaway? The only real “moat”
          is relentless innovation—and the courage to always step boldly onto
          the next frontier.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Thank you, Satya Nadella, for an insightful and energizing
            exploration of what’s next.
          </em>
