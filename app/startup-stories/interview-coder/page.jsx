        </h2>

        <p>
          What's up guys? Coding Jesus here guys. For the past couple of weeks I
          have been talking about LeetCode and why it is not a great tool to
          filter candidates based on real technical ability. It does not show
          how well someone can build, debug, or ship under pressure. It mostly
          measures how much free time someone had to grind patterns and memorize
          hundreds of similar problems. Today I am going to walk you through a
          tool that a viewer showed me about a week ago that lets people cheat
          live LeetCode style interviews in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am honestly surprised more people are not talking about this on
          Twitter, Instagram, or YouTube. This is a big deal. Like, a really,
          really, really big deal for companies that still screen candidates
          with LeetCode style OAs(Online Assessments) and final rounds. This is
          not a tool to become a better developer. This is not even a tool to
          become better at LeetCode. This is a tool that can be used during the
          interview to feed you answers to the exact questions being asked in
          that live code environment. Let me show you how this came onto my
          radar, what I saw when I dug in, and why the ripple effects are going
          to hit FAANG and every company still leaning on these interviews.
        </p>

          <h2>The Email That Kicked This Off</h2>
          <p>
            A subscriber sent me an email with a blunt take on the last decade
            of hiring. The message basically said:
          </p>
          <aside>
            <blockquote>
              In the last decade, LeetCode has been a barrier to FAANG. I think
              the LeetCode era will soon be over. Companies will demand strong
              evidence of raw technical ability in past work. Doing 500 LeetCode
              problems will not get you through the door. Companies will see
              what projects you have built. Do you have a grasp on the
              foundations? To give you an example, Amazon is pretty freaked out
              about this tool <strong>interviewcoder.co</strong>. You can see
              how easy it is to game the LeetCode interview. Recruiters know it
              too. Pretty sure they are looking at different solutions now.

            That email captured a shift a lot of engineers have felt. For years,
            LeetCode has been the barrier. You grind. You memorize. You pray the
            patterns line up on interview day. But this subscriber called out
            something specific. Amazon is freaked. There is a tool. It is called
            interviewcoder.co. And it shows how easy it is to game a LeetCode
            interview. Recruiters already know. They are looking for new
            approaches.

          <h2>Clicking The Link: A Page Titled F**K LeetCode</h2>
          <p>
            When I clicked the link, the page that loaded had a title that
            literally said F**K LeetCode. That immediately caught my attention.
            If you name your product page like that, you are not subtle. You are
            picking a fight with the status quo. I kept scrolling because I
            needed to see what was going on here.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I found was a product built to actively defeat LeetCode-style
            interviews in real time. The pitch was simple. You screenshot the
            question from your OA(Online Assessment) or your live interview. You
            feed that screenshot into their AI. The tool spits back the solution
            on the spot. Not after the interview. Not as a study guide. During
            the interview itself.
          </p>
          <h3>What The Tool Appears To Do</h3>
          <p>
            Since a lot of these interviews are browser-based with an embedded
            editor and a panel showing the prompt, the workflow is pretty
            obvious. You grab a screenshot of the full prompt, including any
            constraints, examples, and hidden notes about input ranges or
            expected complexity. The tool likely uses OCR(Optical Character
            Recognition) to extract the text, identifies the problem pattern,
            and matches it to known solutions or composes a new one. Then it
            generates code in the language you need, along with edge cases and
            test handling. If the interviewer tweaks the prompt or adds a
            follow-up, you screenshot again and the tool adapts.
          </p>
          <p>
            And it is not limited to the OA(Online Assessment). The page makes
            it clear you can use it in the final round too. The positioning was
            not coy. It was direct about being used during a real interview.
          </p>

          <h2>Proof: Watching the Unedited Runs With Interview Coder</h2>
          <p>
            Initially I was skeptical. A lot of tools promise the world and
            deliver something half-baked. So I kept scrolling. Then I ran into
            the part that said: throughout this whole video you will see me use
            Interview Coder for both the OA(Online Assessment) and the final
            round.
          </p>
          <p>
            I watched the Unedited version end to end. I wanted to see the
            transitions, the timing, the lag, the edits, the handoffs between
            the question and the answer. What I saw was wild. The person
            screenshots the question. The tool feeds back a solution in real
            time. The code runs. The tests pass. Follow-up tweaks are handled.
            Output is corrected. They keep moving.
          </p>
          <p>
            They used it to pass a Meta interview. They used it to pass an
            Amazon interview. The result was offers on the table. That is not a
            training montage. That is live fire. And it was mind blowing to
            watch because of how fast it bypassed the whole point of the
            exercise, which is supposed to be thinking on your feet and
            reasoning through a problem under pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you think I’m exaggerating, here is the video — watch it
            yourself. You’ll see exactly what I saw, step by step, in real time.

          <h2>Inside My Old Company: How Teams Tried To Fight AI Cheating</h2>
          <p>
            Back at my previous company, I asked our recruiting team point
            blank: what is our strategy to deal with people using AI to pass
            coding rounds? Their answer was realistic, and it stuck with me.
          </p>
          <p>
            One part of the approach was basically this: we know some candidates
            will use AI to get through certain rounds. We will try to catch them
            in the in person stage. That is where you can see body language, ask
            deeper questions, and push on the why behind the code. You can ask
            them to explain their decisions, change constraints, or build on top
            of their own solution. If they do not understand the code they
            typed, it shows up fast.
          </p>
          <p>
            They also said something else that lines up with what these
            platforms already know. Some questions are marked internally with a
            kind of flag like AI has not yet been able to solve this problem.
            Whether it is LeetCode, HackerRank, or the platform we used, the
            signal is the same. Certain problem types remain hard for models. So
            recruiters were intentionally picking questions that had not been
            solved reliably by AI. Those got included in OAs(Online Assessments)
            and in face to face technical rounds because the hope was those
            questions would surface real problem solving, not copy-paste pattern
            matching.

          <h2>The Interviewing.io Study: What Happens When People Cheat</h2>
          <p>
            When I saw Interview Coder in action, it reminded me of a study
            Interviewing.io ran about cheating in online technical screens. The
            study asked a specific question: how likely is it to pass if you
            cheat with AI compared to not cheating at all?
          </p>
          <h3>How They Set Up The Study</h3>
          <p>
            They split engineers into two groups. One group did not cheat. They
            were the control. They got one random question drawn from a pool
            that included three types of questions. The other group was allowed
            to cheat by using ChatGPT or similar tools. Those cheaters got one
            of three question categories:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Verbatim LeetCode problems that appear exactly as they are found
              online.
            </li>
            <li>
              Modified LeetCode problems that keep the core pattern but change
              details, constraints, or the way the problem is phrased.
            </li>
            <li>
              Custom questions that are not pulled from LeetCode patterns and do
              not have obvious matches online.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The idea was to measure pass rates across these categories and see
            where cheating works and where it breaks down.
          </p>
          <h3>The Results That Matter</h3>
          <p>Here is what they found when they looked at pass rates:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Control group, not cheating, random question: 53 percent pass
              rate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cheaters given verbatim LeetCode problems: 73 percent pass rate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cheaters given modified LeetCode problems: 67 percent pass rate.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cheaters given fully custom questions: 25 percent pass rate.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That drop from 67 to 25 when moving from modified to custom is
            brutal. And here is the kicker. The 25 percent for custom questions
            is not just lower than the other cheating categories. It is
            significantly lower than the control group. So a cheater facing a
            custom question performs worse than a non cheater facing a standard
            LeetCode style question.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Why Custom Questions Are Everywhere Now</h2>
          <p>
            This matches my experience as an interviewee and as an interviewer.
            I had two stages of interviews, one in 2023 and one in 2024. The
            difference between those years was stark. In 2024, the number of
            custom questions I saw went way up, especially in the quantitative
            trading space. Both in OAs(Online Assessments) and in the in person
            technical interviews, custom questions were the default rather than
            the exception.
          </p>
          <p>
            It makes sense. Companies recognize that some candidates will try to
            cheat. If you give a verbatim or lightly modified LeetCode problem,
            AI can often solve it at a high rate, like the 73 and 67 percent we
            just talked about. But when you create a fresh problem that targets
            the fundamentals and forces you to reason, the pass rate for
            cheaters craters to 25 percent. That aligns with the shift I have
            seen firsthand.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>The Wildest Part: No One Was Caught Cheating</h2>
          <p>
            There is something even more surprising in the Interviewing.io
            results. No one was caught cheating. Think about that. If you cheat
            and the worst outcome is that you fail the interview and try again
            later, then the deterrent is weak. There is no blacklisting. There
            is no permanent mark. You just do not pass that round. Then you
            queue up another attempt at some future date.
          </p>
          <p>
            Personally, if you are caught cheating, I think you should be banned
            from interviewing at that company again. That is my take. When I
            interview candidates, the tells are often obvious if you watch
            closely. Someone pastes in a chunk of code and cannot explain a key
            line. They stumble on the invariants they supposedly used to derive
            the approach. Their eyes dart around the screen. You notice color
            shifts reflected in their glasses as a new window pops open. You
            hear the keyboard cadence change when they switch from thinking to
            pasting. Or you see them tab to a prompt window. It is not subtle if
            you are looking for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here is the problem with remote interviews. Unless you are in
            the same room, you do not control the environment. You cannot always
            see the side monitor. You cannot always tell what is off-screen. And
            according to the study, interviewer confidence was actually high.
            Seventy two percent of interviewers said they were confident in
            their hiring decision. So not only were cheaters not being caught,
            interviewers felt good about the calls they were making. That is a
            scary combination if your pipeline depends on these interviews being
            an honest signal.

          <h2>What This Signals For The LeetCode Era</h2>
          <p>
            Going back to that email from my subscriber, the take lands harder
            now. The LeetCode era looks fragile. If a tool like Interview Coder
            lets you screenshot a prompt and get a runnable solution in real
            time, then the barrier between LeetCode-style interviews collapses.
            Recruiters and hiring managers know this. Amazon is reportedly
            freaked, and I do not think they are alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            What fills the gap? The subscriber called it. Companies will demand
            strong evidence of raw technical ability based on past work. Doing
            500 LeetCode problems will not get you through the door. They will
            want to see projects you have built. They will want to see if you
            grasp the foundations. They will want to probe how you design, read
            other peoples code, handle edge cases, and stitch systems together.
            The signal will shift toward proof you can ship, not proof you can
            memorize patterns.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>
            My Closing Thoughts: You Can Cheat An Interview, You Cannot Cheat
            The Job
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am really curious what you guys think about tools like this.
            Because here is where I land. Yes, some people will use a tool like
            Interview Coder to fluke their way into a six figure job. That might
            happen in an OA(Online Assessment). It might even happen in a final
            round if the interviewer is not watching for the tells or if the
            questions align with what the tool can handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            But that is step one. After that, the work starts. There is no
            substitute for actually getting cracked. When your team needs you to
            build a custom backend solution that integrates cleanly into a
            messy, real world infrastructure, AI will not be there to hold your
            hand end to end. When the inputs are noisy, the constraints are
            evolving, and the failure modes are not spelled out in a prompt, you
            either know how to code or you do not. You either know how to read
            other peoples code and extend it without breaking the system or you
            do not. You either write fast, clean, scalable solutions to niche
            problems that no model has memorized or you do not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bottom line: you can game a LeetCode round. You cannot game being a
            strong engineer. Build the skill. Learn the foundations deeply. Get
            good at reading and writing code. Deliver working systems. If tools
            like this push companies to ask for stronger proof of real ability,
            the industry might actually get better at hiring people who can do
            the job for real.
