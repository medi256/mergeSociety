        <p>
          This is a Y Combinator mock interview you can run through right now.
          In the next 10 minutes, I am going to ask you the five biggest
          questions a YC partner will ask you, give you room to answer, then
          show you how to tighten your reply. Treat this like the real thing. No
          excuses. It is go time.

        <section aria-label="about-the-author">
          <h2>Who I Am and Why You Should Practice With Me</h2>
          <p>
            I am Arjun Mahadevan, founder and CEO of Dula.com, a YC batch
            startup in New York City that has raised over 13 million dollars. I
            have sat in this exact hot seat before, which is why I care about
            getting you ready for it. When you are staring down a fast 10 minute
            YC interview, the difference between a crisp answer and a fuzzy one
            can swing the conversation. I have felt the clock ticking, the
            intensity in the room, and the pressure to communicate clearly. That
            is why I built this live run through that you can follow along with
            and actually practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            A quick word on context. Y Combinator is the startup accelerator
            that has funded companies like Airbnb, Dropbox, Stripe, Coinbase,
            and many more that you probably use daily. YC interviews are short,
            intense, and very direct, usually around 10 minutes, with one or
            more partners asking questions as fast as you can answer them. There
            is little fluff. There are no filler slides. You need to explain
            exactly what you do, how far along you are, why you are the right
            people, how you get customers, and how you compare against real
            competitors. That is the game.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-label="how-to-use-this-mock-interview">
          <h2>How To Use This Mock Interview Format</h2>
          <p>
            Practice with me. After each question below, a timer would appear in
            the video. Since you are reading, treat the pause markers as
            intentional stops. Hit pause mentally, write or speak your answer
            out loud, then compare it with the coaching in each section. The
            point is to train the exact muscle you will use in the interview:
            fast, literal, precise communication under pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Visual cue if you were watching: a countdown timer pops in after
            every prompt. I intentionally leave space so you can answer. Then I
            jump back in with the framework, the example, and the common
            mistakes to avoid. Make this interactive for yourself. Do not just
            skim. Say it out loud, time yourself, then refine.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-label="question-1">
          <h2>Question 1: What Are You Working On?</h2>
          <p>
            OK, how did that feel? That single question kicks off almost every
            YC interview. It is simple on paper and surprisingly hard in real
            time. This is the very first question that every partner asks in any
            interview. It sets the tone for the whole conversation because your
            answer reveals your clarity of thought, how well you understand your
            own product, and whether you can communicate without fluff.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is the thing. This is actually the only question that you can
            fully prepare for and practice to the letter. So do it. If there are
            multiple founders, pick one person. One person should answer this,
            and they should answer it as literally as possible.
          </p>

          <h3>How To Answer Literally, Without Jargon</h3>
          <p>
            Do not use jargon like you are transforming or revolutionizing an
            industry. Spell out exactly what you do in plain English. If someone
            overheard your answer in a coffee shop, they should be able to
            repeat it back and get the core of your product right.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, with Dula, I would not say we are revolutionizing
            business formation. That language is vague and sounds like every
            other pitch. I would say we get you an LLC in all 50 states, an EIN,
            set up your bank account, and do your bookkeeping and taxes in one
            place for 3,000 dollars per year. That is literal. That is testable.
            That is a product you can buy.
          </p>

          <h3>Most Common Mistake To Avoid</h3>
          <p>
            The most common mistake here is using too much jargon or too many
            buzzwords. Do not state your grand vision to change humanity. Just
            state what you do with zero ambiguity. If you start with a sweeping
            mission, partners will cut in and ask again: what do you do? Answer
            that first, then let the rest of the interview pull in your vision
            if there is time.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-label="question-2">
          <h2>Question 2: What Is Your Progress So Far?</h2>
          <p>
            This is where you prove you are a doer, not a dreamer. The more
            specific the better. Think in numbers, not adjectives. YC partners
            listen for traction signals that map to real customer behavior and
            real product usage.
          </p>

          <h3>The Formula That Works</h3>
          <p>
            Lead with your most impressive metric. If you do not know your most
            impressive metric well, big red flag. As a startup, and YC hammers
            this point home, you need to have your key metric. That could be
            recurring revenue, it could be product usage, activation, retention,
            or something else that clearly ties to customer value. Ideally it is
            revenue. Revenue is the North Star because it is a hard signal that
            people pay for what you built.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, in bullet point style, follow with other metrics. Keep
            it tight. Here is an example answer:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>We have 1 million in annual recurring revenue.</li>
            <li>We are growing 10 percent week over week.</li>
            <li>We have 1,000 paying customers.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That took two sentences and used precise numbers, leading with the
            most impressive metric. No filler. No backstory. Just traction.
          </p>

          <h3>What Not To Do</h3>
          <p>
            Do not lead with a long story about how you met your cofounder and
            what you have been building. No. They asked how far along are you.
            Be precise. Get to the point. The interview flies by in 10 minutes,
            and every second you spend on backstory is a second you do not spend
            on proof.
          </p>

          <h3>If You Do Not Have Revenue Yet</h3>
          <p>
            If you do not have revenue, you should ideally have product usage.
            Talk about active users, retention, cohorts, weekly actives, or
            shipped features that unlocked a new usage pattern. If you do not
            have product usage, then you need to highlight how quickly you have
            been building, because YC wants to see you can move fast. Speed
            compounds in the early days. They are looking for signs that you can
            turn feedback into product quickly and repeatedly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Say what shipped, when it shipped, what changed because of it, and
            what is next. Treat time as the axis you will win on until revenue
            kicks in.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-label="question-3">
          <h2>Question 3: What Is Your Unique Insight?</h2>
          <p>
            This is the why you question in disguise. It is probing for founder
            market fit. Why are you the best person to solve this problem and to
            build this company, and what have you learned that is non obvious.
            YC wants to understand why you know this market and problem better
            than anyone else in the world. They are testing for a real earned
            insight that changes how you build.
          </p>

          <h3>How To Frame Your Non Obvious Insight</h3>
          <p>
            The formula here is simple. Think hard about a non obvious insight
            you have come across. Then start with a phrase like we discovered
            that or the non obvious insight is and fill in the blank. This sets
            you up to deliver something crisp and surprising.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is an example from Dula. Our non obvious insight is that we
            realized the buyer journey for international founders is backwards
            compared to founders in the United States. For founders in the US,
            the sequence is: pick the name of my LLC, then form the LLC, then
            get a bank account, then bookkeeping, then taxes. That is the
            default order because the system is familiar, the forms are known,
            and the friction shows up later in the stack.
          </p>
          <p>
            But for international founders, it is flipped. International
            founders have more questions about taxes than they do about
            formation. They are thinking about tax residency, treaty rules, how
            to pay themselves, and how not to mess up compliance before they
            even select an entity. Yet almost every alternative in the market
            was leading with formation as if that was the main problem. So we
            flipped the script. That was our non obvious insight, and we learned
            it from talking to customers over and over.
          </p>

          <h3>Common Mistake To Avoid</h3>
          <p>
            Do not just describe the market. Really sit down and think what is
            non obvious. You want the partner to walk away thinking, huh, I
            learned something new from that answer. If you cannot find a unique
            insight, here is the harsh truth. You might not have done enough
            research or you are not truly doing something that is non consensus
            enough.
          </p>
          <p>
            And why does that matter? If it is not non consensus enough, and
            other people are doing the exact same thing in the exact same way,
            competition will be fierce. That does not mean you cannot succeed.
            But the idea with a unique insight is you have a secret you are in
            on before the rest of the world knows. That secret changes your
            product roadmap, your distribution, or your business model in a way
            that compounds.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-label="question-4">
          <h2>Question 4: How Do You Plan To Get Users?</h2>
          <p>
            How will you get your first 1,000 customers. YC partners are testing
            whether you have a concrete plan to acquire customers. Because here
            is the truth: most companies do not die because they fail to build
            the product. Most companies die because they fail to repeatedly
            acquire customers at a low enough customer acquisition cost. Say
            that four times.
          </p>

          <h3>The Acquisition Plan They Want To Hear</h3>
          <p>
            You need to have a plan to acquire customers. Describe as tactfully
            and specifically as possible what your repeatable process is. Name
            the channels. Show the depth. Go one level deeper than just label
            words.
          </p>
          <p>For Dula, for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A third of our acquisition is through Google paid ads. We capture
              search based intent like how to start LLC in the US. That intent
              signal means people are already in motion.
            </li>
            <li>
              A third of our acquisition is through channel partnerships with
              communities, courses, and influencers who teach people how to
              start a business on Shopify. We give them a commission so
              incentives are aligned. They educate, we handle the back office.
            </li>
            <li>
              A third of our acquisition is through word of mouth. Founders know
              founders. We build a great product, they tell their friends, and
              that compounding loop lowers our blended CAC over time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Short, crisp, precise, to the point.</p>

          <h3>Be Specific, Not Broad</h3>
          <p>
            The common mistake here is to be too broad. Be specific. You noticed
            how I named the channels, and I went one level deeper. I did not
            just say Google Ads. I gave the keyword. I did not just say
            partnerships. I talked about the type of partner and the context,
            like Shopify focused creators and communities. And I did not just
            say word of mouth. I said why it works. I said founders know
            founders.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section aria-label="question-5">
          <h2>
            Question 5: Who Are Your Main Competitors and Why Are You Different?
          </h2>
          <p>
            This is a test of your market knowledge and your confidence. Never
            say you do not have competitors, because you always will have
            competitors. Even if a market is new, people are solving the problem
            some other way. The status quo is a competitor. DIY is a competitor.
            A spreadsheet is a competitor.
          </p>

          <h3>How To Answer With Clarity</h3>
          <p>
            Name exactly the top one to two competitors. Then state your key
            differentiator in one sentence. State your right to win, or why you
            are different. Keep it clean.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is an example we get a lot. People ask, what about Stripe
            Atlas, which is a phenomenal company by the way. Anyone helping
            entrepreneurs, rising tide lifts all boats, I am in full support of.
            But here is how we are different from Stripe Atlas.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Stripe Atlas focuses on venture backed C Corps. We focus on
              solopreneurs or LLC. Different customer, different needs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Stripe Atlas offers formation. We offer more downstream services
              like bookkeeping, taxes, and ecommerce analytics for Shopify
              entrepreneurs versus a broad based solution for tech or venture
              backed founders.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Name the competitor. Name your differentiator in one clear sentence.
            Do not say you do not have competition.
          </p>

          <h3>The Reality About Competition</h3>
          <p>
            Here is the truth. If you do not want competition, you should not
            leave your room. You should stay inside all day. And you definitely
            should not start a startup. There will always be competition in a
            space where there is an opportunity to build something cool for
            customers.

        <section aria-label="wrap-and-practice">
          <h2>That Is Time. Now Go Again.</h2>
          <p>
            There we go. I hope you actually pressed pause and ran your answers.
            You can also go back, restart, and practice these questions again.
            Practice makes perfect, especially when the format rewards sharp,
            repeatable answers.
          </p>

          <h3>The Three Biggest Things To Do In A YC Interview</h3>
          <p>
            I have a separate video on this, but here are the three biggest
            things, summarized exactly the way I want you to remember them:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Know your answer to that first question.</li>
            <li>
              Know the three things you want to share in the interview no matter
              what, because time is going to fly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be concise, avoid jargon and buzzwords, and answer the question
              directly.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you hold those three constraints, you will sound sharper, you
            will keep control of your message, and you will make it easier for
            the partners to say yes.
          </p>

          <h2>Bonus: A Small Easter Egg For You</h2>
          <p>
            By the way, here is a little Easter egg. If anyone watching this
            actually gets a YC mock interview, I want to pay it forward. So if
            you made it this far and you have gotten a YC mock interview, you
            can email me. It is arjunula.com saying hey, I have got a mock
            interview and I would love to do a mock interview with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope this does not go too viral because then I will be doing a lot
            of mock interviews. But if it helps you get sharper and win, that is
            time well spent.

            and take care of your back office so you can focus on what you do
            best while Dula handles the rest.

          <h2>Free Resource: 50 Plus YC Questions</h2>
          <p>
            Lastly, as a bonus, I have included down below the list of 50 plus
            YC questions. This is a free guide. It pops in a Google Doc. You can
            check it out down below. This walkthrough covered five key
            questions, but if you really want to practice with more questions,
            check out the Google Doc link below.

          <h2>Final Takeaways</h2>
          <p>
            Keep the order. Keep the pacing. Keep the clarity. Answer literally
            what you do. Lead with your best metric. Share the non obvious
            insight you earned. Name how you acquire customers with channel
            level detail. Acknowledge your competitors and state your right to
            win in one sentence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do that, and when the clock starts in a YC interview, you will not
            just survive the next 10 minutes. You will drive them.
