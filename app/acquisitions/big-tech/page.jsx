        </h2>

        <p>
          In the high-stakes world of technology, a billion dollars can seem
          like pocket change. Yet, just over two decades ago, a billion-dollar
          deal was remarkable enough to make headlines. Cast your memory back to
          January 2000: Microsoft made its first-ever acquisition worth a cool
          US$1 billion, purchasing Vizio Corporation, a Seattle-based company
          known for its diagramming software. It was a pivotal move—one that
          foreshadowed a new era of tech consolidation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast-forward 22 years, and Microsoft once again turned heads,
          announcing the largest acquisition in its history—and the biggest in
          the tech sector to date. The target? Gaming powerhouse Activision
          Blizzard, in a staggering cash-and-stock transaction valued at US$68.7
          billion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>How big is $68.7 billion?</strong> For some real-world
          context: that’s roughly equal to the annual GDP of Guatemala, a nation
          of 17 million people. In other words, Microsoft was prepared to spend
          on one video game company what a small country would generate in an
          entire year.
        </p>
        <h2>The Famga Five: Tech’s Top Acquisition Kings</h2>
        <p>
          The giants driving these blockbuster deals are commonly referred to as{" "}
          <strong>FAMGA</strong>—that’s Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and
          Amazon. Over the last three decades, these five titans have
          collectively made over <strong>800 acquisitions</strong>, with 35 of
          those valued at more than a billion dollars each.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might guess that Apple—with its famous cash reserves—would lead
          the pack in massive acquisitions. Surprisingly, Apple actually trails
          behind its peers in billion-dollar deals. In fact, the company has
          only made two acquisitions north of a billion: Beats Electronics (for
          $3 billion) and Intel's smartphone modem business (for $1 billion).

          Facebook isn’t very far ahead, coming in fourth, but its
          billion-dollar deals were nonetheless headline-grabbing. Its notable
          purchases include WhatsApp, Oculus, Instagram, and Control Labs,
          making for a total of five such major acquisitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amazon edges ahead into third, logging six billion-dollar or larger
          purchases. These include household names and staples like the Whole
          Foods grocery chain and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), the legendary film
          studio.
        </p>
        <p>
          Google—no stranger to splurging—takes second place with eight major
          acquisitions. Their shopping list features big names like Motorola,
          smart-thermostat leader Nest, and the essential ad platform
          DoubleClick.

        <h2>Microsoft: King of Big Tech Acquisitions</h2>
        <p>
          And then there’s Microsoft:{" "}
          <strong>the undisputed champion of tech acquisition spending</strong>.
          Over the years, Microsoft has completed 13 acquisitions valued above
          $1 billion, covering a vast swath—from gaming companies and
          productivity tools to development environments.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Activision Blizzard deal closes, Microsoft will not only hold
          the record for the biggest FAMGA acquisition ever but will also own
          two of the three largest tech buys to date. The only other contender
          in the top three is Facebook’s $22 billion purchase of WhatsApp, which
          takes the bronze to Microsoft's gold (Activision Blizzard) and silver
          (LinkedIn).
        </p>
        <p>
          To put another feather in Microsoft’s cap, the proposed Activision
          Blizzard acquisition would also rank as not just the biggest FAMGA
          deal but the{" "}
          <strong>biggest gaming industry acquisition in history</strong>
          —by an overwhelming margin.

        <h2>When Big Tech Buys Go Wrong</h2>
        <p>
          But these mega-acquisitions aren’t always a highway to success. Some,
          in fact, have turned into cautionary tales. Let's revisit two of the
          most infamous flops:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Microsoft and Nokia (2013)</strong>: Microsoft spent $5
            billion to acquire Nokia’s handset division, along with $2.2 billion
            for patent licenses—moves that then-CEO Steve Ballmer called “a bold
            step into the future.” Unfortunately, within just a few years, the
            project failed to gain traction and new CEO Satya Nadella wrote off
            the entire investment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Google and Motorola Mobility (2011)</strong>: Google bet
            big—$12.5 billion—on Motorola’s handset business and patent trove,
            hoping to shield itself from ongoing patent disputes. The patents
            proved useful, but Motorola’s hardware division faltered, and was
            sold two years later to Lenovo for just $2.9 billion—a spectacularly
            fast and costly loss.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Microsoft’s Relentless Acquisition Streak</h2>
        <p>
          If you zoom out for the <strong>big picture</strong>, Microsoft
          emerges as the tech world’s most prolific dealmaker. Since first
          entering the M&amp;A scene in 1987, Microsoft has snapped up an
          average of six companies every year. Their appetite for corporate
          growth remains undiminished; since the start of 2020 alone, Microsoft
          has completed 25 acquisitions—eclipsing all four of its FAMGA peers,
          both in size and quantity.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who love business drama and digital empires, one thing is
          clear: Microsoft continues to set the pace in the world of high-value
          tech deals, buying at a rate—and scale—that few can match.
