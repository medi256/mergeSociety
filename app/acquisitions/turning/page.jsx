        <p>
          Welcome, ambitious dealmakers and business dreamers! Today, we're
          diving deep into the ultimate, advanced acquisition strategy: how to
          turn $100,000 into $50 million through savvy business acquisitions.
          This isn’t your typical “start a business from scratch” play—this is
          about sophisticated capital allocation, sharp deal-making, and
          understanding how money truly multiplies when you buy, build, and
          scale companies. If you’ve ever wondered how the pros do it, or what’s
          possible when you think beyond entrepreneurship-as-usual, buckle up.
        </p>

        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>
          I'm <strong>Walker Deibel</strong>, Wall Street Journal bestselling
          author of <em>Buy Then Build</em> and founder of Acquisition Lab, a
          hands-on accelerator for elite business buyers. My passion: pulling
          back the curtain on acquisition strategies normally reserved for
          private equity insiders—so those equipped and motivated can seize the
          opportunities most people don’t even know exist.
        </p>

        <h2>Rethinking Entrepreneurship: It’s Not What You Think</h2>
        <p>
          Let’s be candid—even though this strategy requires a specific skill
          set and readiness, it yields results that outpace the “start-up grind”
          most entrepreneurs are familiar with. If you’re ready to step up and
          move towards business acquisitions (or you’re simply curious), I want
          you to understand what’s possible. Maybe you already own a company and
          want to turbocharge growth through M&amp;A, or perhaps you’re
          considering entering the world of acquisition entrepreneurship. No
          matter where you are, this is your advanced roadmap.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Breaking Down the Capital Stack: Buying a Business Isn’t So Different
          From Buying a Home
        </h2>
        <p>
          The cornerstone of this methodology is understanding the{" "}
          <strong>capital stack</strong>: how you finance and structure your
          deals. Imagine you’re buying your primary residence. Typically, you’d
          put down a <strong>20% cash infusion</strong>—that’s your equity. The
          remaining <strong>80% comes from a mortgage</strong>. Over time, you
          repay the mortgage with your own job earnings elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, with business acquisitions, things get much more interesting.
          Instead of you needing a salary to pay off the debt, you’re buying an
          asset—a company with real cashflow. The business’s revenue{" "}
          <em>pays off the loan</em>, pays you a salary, and sometimes even
          leaves extra capital to reinvest in growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, just like home buying, your capital stack here typically consists
          of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Equity (your down payment):</strong> Your personal cash, or
            what you raise from others.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Senior secured debt (bank loan):</strong> The majority of
            the purchase price, often provided by banks—sometimes via{" "}
            <abbr title="Small Business Administration">SBA</abbr> loans.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Potential second positions:</strong> Just like a “second
            mortgage” or <abbr title="Home Equity Line of Credit">HELOC</abbr>{" "}
            on a house, you might have a portion financed as a secondary loan or
            seller note.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What Type of Businesses To Target</h2>
        <p>
          For this playbook,{" "}
          <strong>we’re hunting companies with $1–3 million in earnings</strong>{" "}
          (EBITDA). Start near the $1 million mark—it’s where you’ll likely have
          the most actionable opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Businesses are valued at a <strong>multiple of their earnings</strong>
          . Suppose you find a business with $1 million in annual profits. You
          might offer a “multiple” (say, 4x) so your target price lands at $4
          million. Sometimes, after negotiation (inventory, working capital,
          etc.), the price rises to $4.5 million.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using tools like <strong>SBA loans</strong>, you might only need to
          put down 10–20% of that price in cash—so $100k–$200k out-of-pocket for
          a $1M cash-flowing business. The rest is financed by the bank.
        </p>

        <h2>Equity: Your Money, Seller’s Money, or Someone Else’s?</h2>
        <p>
          You don’t always need to fund that entire equity check yourself. There
          are three main sources:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Your own money</strong> (the bank always likes this best!)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Outside investors</strong> (classic “raise from angels”
            approach)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Seller notes:</strong> Sometimes, the seller will finance a
            portion for you. The SBA even encourages this. Seller notes often
            count as <em>pseudo-equity</em> from the bank’s view, especially if
            they’re subordinated ("second position").
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          A quick reality check: If you approach deals where you <em>must</em>{" "}
          have the seller finance a chunk, you’ll often be outbid by buyers
          ready to pay more cash at closing. But don’t lose hope—there’s a
          creative workaround coming up.
        </p>

        <h2>How The Capital Stack Pays Out (When Things Go South)</h2>
        <p>
          Suppose you acquire a business for $4.5 million, but then it stumbles
          and can only be sold for $2 million. The{" "}
          <strong>senior secured lender (the bank) gets paid first</strong>.
          Only after the senior note is settled do subordinate lenders or equity
          holders receive anything. This sequence of payment is
          crucial—understanding “who gets paid first” is what risk management is
          all about.
        </p>

        <h2>The Creative Roll-Up Strategy: 10x Your Value Through Structure</h2>
        <p>
          Here’s where this advanced playbook really shines. Instead of
          competing in crowded markets or with brokers (where sellers are
          swarmed and high on options),{" "}
          <strong>target “off-market” sellers</strong>. These are business
          owners not actively selling, less pressed for immediate cash, and more
          open to creative, win-win structures.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <strong>Script:</strong>
          <br />
          “Seller, I want you to own 20% equity in the new company (‘Newco’)
          we’re forming. I’ll pay you 60% of your company’s value in cash at
          closing. The remaining 20% will be a seller’s note (deferred over
          time), possibly split so half is an earn-out based on future
          performance and half is a classic long-term note.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          <strong>Why would sellers say yes?</strong> Because in the new larger
          entity, their 20% might double in value—they’re essentially trading
          upfront cash for a bigger slice of a much larger, more valuable pie.
          Plus, they often stick around, drawing a fair salary, focusing on
          running their old business without the burdens of ownership.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Here’s the magic:</strong> With each deal structured like
          this, from the bank’s perspective, you show a whopping 40% equity—yet
          much of this is pledged by future seller notes or rolled-over equity,
          not cash from your own wallet.
        </p>

        <h2>
          The Power of Multiple Expansion: From Single Acquisitions to “Roll-Up”
          Valuations
        </h2>
        <p>
          Imagine assembling 10 businesses, each earning $1–3 million in EBITDA.
          Rolled together, this new group can command{" "}
          <strong>higher valuation multiples</strong>—growing from 4.5x to 7.5x
          or more. Why? Larger companies are more attractive to buyers
          (especially private equity), perceived as less risky, and justify
          “multiple expansion.”
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, ten $2M EBITDA firms rolled up become a $20M-earnings
          platform. Instead of a $4.5M valuation for each, the group could sell
          for $150M (at 7.5x)—that’s a dramatic value unlock. But, a warning:
          simply owning ten disconnected companies isn’t enough. They must be
          integrated—shared systems, unified culture, centralized operations, a
          formal board, and HQ functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Each subsidiary (the acquired companies) pays a reasonable
            management fee to Newco
          </strong>
          , which funds the shared administration. This “roll-up” is classic
          private equity territory, now open to sharp operators who play their
          cards right.
        </p>

        <h2>Appealing to Sellers: Why Partner With You?</h2>
        <p>
          When pitching to owners, emphasize that their “retained” 20% could
          become far more valuable as part of a bigger, better organization.
          After 3–5 years, with the planned exit, they can often walk away with
          much more than if they’d simply sold for cash today.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also incentivize managers by letting them buy in—selling 10%
          to the key management team, for example, rather than just handing out
          free shares. Structure it equitably: discount or at full enterprise
          value as suits your style and your recruiting needs.
        </p>

        <h2>Why $100,000? Skin in the Game Still Matters</h2>
        <p>
          It may sound like zero of your own money is needed, but—
          <strong>skin in the game matters</strong>. Banks want to see you
          committed. You’ll face costs for deal sourcing, due diligence, legal
          work, and quality of earnings reports—not to mention the endless
          coffee and lunches to win those first deals. But after the first
          acquisition, the capital you free up or leverage from it can be used
          for deal number two, three, and beyond. Rinse and repeat until you hit
          your roll-up goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, you sell the newly built conglomerate to private
          equity—cashing out (at those expanded multiples!) to the tune of $50
          million and beyond.
        </p>
