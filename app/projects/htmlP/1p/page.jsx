      <h2>Understanding HTML - Your Website's Building Blocks</h2>
      <h3>Let's Start Our Web Journey!</h3>

      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Imagine you're building a house üè†. Just like a house needs a
            foundation, walls, and a roof, a webpage needs something to give it
            structure. That's where HTML comes in!
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>What exactly is HTML?</h4>
          <p>
            HTML is like a set of building blocks for websites. Think of it this
            way:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              HTML stands for <span>HyperText Markup Language</span>
              (don't worry about memorizing this - just remember it's the
              language websites are built with!)
            </li>
            <li>
              If a webpage was a sandwich, HTML would be the bread that holds
              everything together
            </li>
            <li>
              HTML uses special "tags" - they're like containers that tell your
              browser "hey, this is a heading" or "this is a paragraph"
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>üëâ What We'll Build Together:</h4>
          <p>
            We're going to create your very own personal webpage! Think of it as
            your digital business card. It will have:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your name at the top (like a welcome sign)</li>
            <li>A section about you (your digital introduction)</li>
            <li>Your awesome skills (showing what you can do)</li>
            <li>Ways to contact you (helping others reach out)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>‚ú® Don't worry if you're completely new to this!</p>
          <p>
            We'll take it step by step, explain everything in simple terms, and
            use lots of examples. It's like following a recipe - we'll add one
            ingredient at a time!
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Getting Ready - Setting Up Your Workspace </h2>
      <h3>Let's Get Your Workspace Ready!</h3>

      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Before we start coding, we need to set up our workspace. It's just
            like preparing your desk before starting homework - you need
            everything in the right place! üìö
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>Step 1: Create Your Project Folder</h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              Think of this folder as a special drawer just for your website
              files:
            </p>

            <div>
              <p>üëâ If you're using Windows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Right-click on your desktop</li>
                <li>Move your mouse to "New"</li>
                <li>Click "Folder"</li>
                <li>Name it "my-first-website"</li>
              </ol>

              <p>üëâ If you're using Mac:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Right-click on your desktop</li>
                <li>Click "New Folder"</li>
                <li>Name it "my-first-website"</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>Step 2: Choose Your Text Editor</h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              A text editor is like your digital pencil and paper. We recommend
              Visual Studio Code (VS Code) because it's:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Free to download</li>
              <li>Easy to use</li>
              <li>Helps you write code better with helpful hints</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
              <p>üîç How to get VS Code:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Go to "code.visualstudio.com"</li>
                <li>Click the big download button</li>
                <li>Install it just like any other program</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>Step 3: Create Your First HTML File</h4>
          <div>
            <p>Now let's create your website's main file:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Open VS Code</li>
              <li>Click "File" ‚Üí "Open Folder"</li>
              <li>Find and select your "my-first-website" folder</li>
              <li>
                Click "New File" (or press Ctrl+N on Windows, Cmd+N on Mac)
              </li>
              <li>
                Save it as "index.html" (this is always the main page of a
                website)
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>üéâ Congratulations!</p>
          <p>
            You've just set up your web development workspace! Think of it as
            having your artist's studio ready - now we can start creating! In
            the next step, we'll start writing our first HTML code.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2> Writing Your First HTML - The Building Blocks</h2>
      <h3>Let's Write Our First HTML!</h3>

      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Think of HTML like building with LEGO¬Æ blocks. Each piece has a
            specific shape and purpose, and when you put them together, you
            create something amazing! üèóÔ∏è
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>The Basic Structure</h4>
          <p>Copy this code into your index.html file:</p>
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="html" style={docco}>
                {`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My Personal Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>`}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>

          <div>
            <h5>Let's break this down - piece by piece:</h5>

            <div>
              <div>
                <p>{`1. <!DOCTYPE html>`}</p>
                <p>
                  This is like telling your browser "Hey, this is a webpage!"
                  It's like putting a label on a box so everyone knows what's
                  inside.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <p>{`2. <html lang="en">`}</p>
                <p>
                  This is the container for your entire webpage. Think of it as
                  the outer walls of your house - everything goes inside here!
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <p>{`3. <head>`}</p>
                <p>
                  This is like the control room of your webpage. It contains
                  important information that visitors don't see but your browser
                  needs to know.
                </p>
              </div>

              <div>
                <p>{`4. <body>`}</p>
                <p>
                  This is where all the visible stuff goes - your text, images,
                  everything visitors will see. Think of it as the furnished
                  rooms in your house.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4>üëâ Try It Out!</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Copy the code above into your index.html file</li>
            <li>Save the file (Ctrl+S on Windows, Cmd+S on Mac)</li>
            <li>Find your file in your folder and double-click it</li>
            <li>It should open in your web browser!</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Right now you'll see a blank page - that's normal! In the next step,
            we'll start adding content to make it look awesome! üåü

      <h3>Creating Your Website Header</h3>

      <div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Think of a header like the cover of a book - it's the first thing
            people see! Let's make yours stand out with your name and what you
            do. üìö

                <p>{`1. <header>`}</p>
                <p>
                  This is like the front door of your website. It's where you

                <p>{`2. <h1>`}</p>
                <p>
                  This is the biggest heading - like your name on a giant
                  welcome sign. You only use one h1 per page because it's the
                  main title.

              </div>

                <p>
                  This is a slightly smaller heading - perfect for your title or
                  what you do. Think of it as your subtitle.

                <p>
                  This creates a bullet-point list - perfect for skills! Think
                  of it like making a shopping list.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Each skill goes in its own {` <li> `} tag - like each item on
                  your shopping list

                <p>{`1. <footer>`}</p>
                <p>
                  This is like the last page of a book - it's where you put
                  contact info and final notes
                </p>
              </div>

                <p>{`2. <a> (Link)`}</p>
                <p>
                  These are like magical doors - when clicked, they take
                  visitors to your email or social profiles!
