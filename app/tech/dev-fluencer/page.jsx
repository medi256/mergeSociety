Each archetype is analyzed through a humorous but insightful lens, highlighting their defining characteristics, motivations, and impact on the broader tech ecosystem.

          But here’s the untold truth: as you dive deeper into technology,
          you’ll encounter a colorful cast of characters. The most common trait?
          Not dazzling IQs. No, it’s that they’re all <em>annoying</em> and{" "}
          <em>obnoxious</em> in their own unique way. And let’s not pretend I’m
          above it all—after all, who’s more insufferable than the{" "}
          <strong>devfluencer</strong>? That’s right: me.
        </p>

        <h2>
          The Evolution of the Devfluencer: From Mediocre Books to TikTok Brain
          Rot
        </h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Dev Influencer</strong> isn’t a new phenomenon. Back in
          the 2000s, devfluencers were hawking mediocre programming books—more
          likely to cure your insomnia than your coding woes. By the 2010s, they
          upgraded to hosting expensive online courses. As we progressed to the
          2020s, the hustle has shifted: now it’s all about getting you to
          subscribe to their Twitch stream for the perfect bargain of{" "}
          <strong>$5 a month</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the old days, becoming a coding creator{" "}
          <em>actually required skills</em>. At minimum, you had to write a few
          lines of code and drum up a catchy title for an otherwise abysmal
          book. But today? All you really need is a mustache and a snarky,
          polarizing hot take on web development. No longer is your favorite
          code editor Vim or Emacs—it’s <strong>CapCut</strong>, so you can
          crank out TikToks of questionable value at blazingly fast speeds.
        </p>

        <h2>The True Menace: The Blogger</h2>
        <p>
          But devfluencers aren’t the final boss.{" "}
          <strong>The real scourge of tech influencers?</strong> Bloggers. If
          you’ve ever been in the thick of coding, desperately searching “how to
          reverse a list in Python,” you know the pain. The top search result is
          always a rambling, over-SEO’d post from some random company or
          consultancies with names like “Code Solution Hub.” Before giving you
          one actual line of code, you’re treated to a whopping{" "}
          <strong>9,000-word essay</strong> on the ancient origins of the
          written word. All you wanted was <code>list.reverse()</code>, and
          instead, you got a lesson in <em>cuneiform</em>.
        </p>

        <h2>The Codepreneur: All About the Benjamins (and JS Templates)</h2>
        <p>
          Enter the <strong>codepreneur</strong>: the evil twin of the
          devfluencer. Their entire self-worth, identity, and even awkward chats
          with their mother revolve around one thing: money. A telltale sign?
          Just check their Twitter bio. Their proudest achievement is having
          earned big bucks—selling, naturally, a generic Next.js template. Call
          them out for recycling the same code as everyone else, and you’re
          instantly blocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The codepreneur archetype is almost always European, which—if we’re
          being cheeky—mirrors modern European society: think “pickpocketing”
          and “zero innovation.” When Americans want to scam you, at least they
          brand it as SaaS. But for codepreneurs, programming is just a means to
          an end—there’s no love for software engineering, only for cold, hard
          cash.
        </p>

        <h2>The Sales Guy: Temporarily Embarrassed Millionaires</h2>
        <p>
          But wait, it gets worse. Imagine the <em>codepreneur</em> graduates,
          and instead of learning to code, morphs into...{" "}
          <strong>the Sales Guy</strong>. These folks—self-proclaimed
          “temporarily embarrassed millionaires”—are the true force of chaos in
          your coworking space. Ever had the misfortune of sharing an office
          with them? You’ll know, because they’re the ones screeching with glee
          about closing a six-figure deal for a feature that, surprise, doesn’t
          exist yet. And now it’s needed... in two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Decked out in a Rolex and Arc’teryx jacket to compensate for never
          having built a tangible skill in their life, the Sales Guy pulls
          legendary overtime hours doing supremely{" "}
          <em>mentally stimulating work</em>: crafting slide decks, replying to
          endless emails, and scheduling meetings as if their lives depend on
          it.
        </p>

        <h2>Product Managers: Praise Without Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          Who else lurks in the tech jungle? <strong>Product people</strong>.
          Product managers are what happens when you’re neither technical enough
          for software engineering nor charismatic enough for sales. Big Tech
          needed a way to keep their nepo babies employed, and CEOs needed
          someone to handle the tasks intelligence and ambition alone can’t
          tackle. Product Managers: They’re in charge of the search bar on
          Reddit—the one whose existence makes you question your own
          purpose—just remember, that functionality has its own dedicated,
          salaried overseer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Product managers have a knack for getting heaps of praise while seldom
          doing concrete work. That’s why so many end up as CEOs. And if you
          ever wondered why “vibe coding” videos rack up so many views? You can
          thank your friendly neighborhood product manager.
        </p>

        <h2>Tech Supremacists: The Obsessive, Opinionated Die-hards</h2>
        <p>
          The tech industry has its share of supremacists—think of them as the
          hardline fans who believe the technology they champion is the alpha
          and omega of human achievement. Disagree? Clearly, you’re wrong in
          their book. While sometimes a pain to interact with, tech supremacists
          at least <strong>study technology deeply</strong> and are often net
          positives for the community. Ever found a super detailed, life-saving
          blog post about an obscure Docker bug? Thank a tech supremacist.
        </p>
        <p>
          But don’t get too cozy. These folks still fall into the category of
          “difficult to be around.” Case in point: Linux users. They save a
          fortune, not from tech salaries, but from never purchasing deodorant
          or cologne. We salute their commitment to open source—and questionable
          hygiene.
        </p>

        <h2>FAANG Sexuals: Maximizing Shareholder Value, One Soul at a Time</h2>
        <p>
          For every would-be crypto bro determined to break free of “the
          Matrix,” there’s an army of studious overachievers—affectionately
          dubbed the <strong>FAANG sexuals</strong>—ready to sacrifice
          everything for a shot at using the <em>bathroom at Google HQ</em>.
          Personality? Optional. Shareholder value? Essential. Sometimes, they
          even dabble in content creation—but not about exciting topics like
          distributed systems or scalable databases. No, it’s all about how they
          started leetcoding at the tender age of four, and if you didn’t...
          well, tough luck for your dreams.
        </p>

        <h2>
          The Moral? Tech’s a Quirky Parade—Mostly Odorless, Occasionally
          Parasitic
        </h2>
        <p>
          So, what did chronicling this expedition into tech subcultures teach
          me? At best, everyone in technology skips the deodorant aisle—at
          worst, they’re parasitic and a net negative for society.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I entered the tech industry five years ago, I envisioned meeting
          the sharpest minds, the guardians upholding our digital world.
          Instead, I collided with a glorious circus of oddballs who couldn’t
          hold a conversation with your neighborhood mechanic (and let’s
          appreciate mechanics—they’re genuinely brilliant folks).
