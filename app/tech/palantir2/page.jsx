        </h2>

        <p>
          Criticizing your former employer is a move that’s often frowned upon.
          But what happens when that employer not only shapes your paycheck, but
          also wields vast, lethal technologies and surveillance tools used on
          battlefields and within cities alike? That’s a very different — and
          far more unsettling — situation.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 2025, government surveillance and the erosion of personal privacy
          have become part of the digital background noise. The prevailing
          assumption: someone somewhere is always watching us, and our private
          data lives in places we can’t even imagine. Meanwhile, taxpayers have
          grown accustomed to the military funneling billions to a handful of
          monolithic defense contractors. Enter Palantir — a tech juggernaut
          with its sights set on rewriting both rules: not only dominating the
          military contracting space but also becoming the grand gatekeeper of
          data worldwide.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner
            with the very best in the world. And when it’s necessary, to scare
            enemies and, on occasion, kill them.”
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The stock market seems to approve. Palantir shares leapt 22% after a
          surge in government demand for its AI-driven software. This is a
          company that promises to revolutionize government operations. From its
          home base in Denver, Palantir has secured contracts with the
          Department of Defense, FBI, local police departments, the IRS — even
          fast food giant, Wendy’s. Their pitch? Gather all the disparate
          information those organizations collect, synthesize even more, and
          then use algorithms to draw powerful, actionable conclusions.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>But what’s really happening under the hood?</strong> Let’s
          peel back the layers. This journey weaves through the experience of a
          former Palantir employee, decades of critical research, and the very
          words of CEO Alex Karp — to reveal how Palantir’s sales pitch is
          rooted in capitalizing on fear, disruption, and the promise of
          technological dominance.
        </p>

        <h2>The Genesis of Palantir: Born in the Age of Fear</h2>

        <p>
          Fear sells, and few understood this better than the creators of
          Palantir. In the wake of 9/11, the United States raced to expand both
          domestic and foreign surveillance. The defense sector reaped the
          rewards. Around the same time, the Silicon Valley tech boom minted
          fortunes overnight, including those behind PayPal, like Elon Musk,
          Reid Hoffman (the LinkedIn visionary), and Peter Thiel.
        </p>
        <p>
          After PayPal’s acquisition, Thiel had both the capital and the
          curiosity to apply fraud detection concepts to the world at large. He
          tapped his Stanford Law roommate — Alex Karp, a doctor not of computer
          science, but of neoclassical social theory — to help realize this
          vision. They named their new enterprise Palantir, after the palantíri
          from J.R.R. Tolkien’s <em>Lord of the Rings</em>: crystal balls that
          could peer across distances and even through time — “meant to be used
          for good, but incredibly dangerous if wielded with the wrong
          intentions.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In Tolkien’s legendarium, these stones granted their users tremendous
          power and influence. In our world, Palantir’s software — powered now
          by artificial intelligence — provides governments and corporations
          with similarly far-reaching capabilities.
        </p>

        <h2>What Does Palantir Actually Do?</h2>

        <p>
          Palantir’s technology enables clients to gather and analyze massive
          pools of data — seeking “predicates” or patterns that might indicate
          risks, threats, or opportunities. As CEO Karp once put it: “We would
          look at you, and say: what things in your life add up to a risk?” In
          plain language,{" "}
          <strong>
            they make it easier for their customers to draw sweeping, actionable
            conclusions from oceans of raw data
          </strong>{" "}
          — often with minimal human intervention, thanks to AI.
        </p>

        <p>
          By 2013, just ten years into its journey, Palantir was already serving
          the FBI, CIA, NSA, Marine Corps, Air Force Special Operations, and
          more — often shrouded in secrecy. When pressed on whether Palantir’s
          tools aided in tracking Osama bin Laden, employees coyly reference “a
          2/3 chance” of being involved, depending on the country.
        </p>

        <h2>The Internal Mechanics: A Mission Driven by Militarism</h2>

        <p>
          Palantir’s internal culture revolves around the conviction that
          they’re solving “the world’s hardest problems” — upholding Western
          institutions, security, and, above all, dominance. As Karp says, “If
          you do not feel comfortable supporting the legitimate efforts of
          America and its allies in the context of war, don’t join Palantir.”
          The rhetoric is unapologetically martial.
        </p>
        <p>
          The language they use in private is even more direct. Employees talk
          about building systems for “the kill chain,” a military term
          describing the sequence of steps leading from identifying to
          neutralizing (or killing) a target — Palantir’s tech makes this
          process faster, more efficient, and, yes, more lethal. The lawyers may
          wordsmith a “tech for the amelioration of unwanted outcomes,” but
          inside the company, the term “kill chain” is commonly used.
        </p>
        <p>
          The “kill chain” is not uniquely Palantir’s, but by embedding their
          AI-driven tools, they’ve deeply integrated themselves into the
          process. As one former employee noted, the power to shape how data is
          collected, interpreted, and acted upon — from the battlefield to
          boardroom — is almost god-like, and can cause moral whiplash for those
          on the inside. For some, like ex-employee Juan, it led to
          soul-searching and eventual whistleblowing.
        </p>

        <h2>Palantir’s Reach: From Gaza to Government Contracts</h2>
        <p>
          Juan’s break with Palantir was catalyzed during the Israeli invasion
          of Gaza after October 7. While Palantir’s exact contracts with the
          Israeli Defense Forces remain intentionally opaque, mounting evidence
          strongly suggests their AI was used to select targets in Gaza. For
          Palantir, the controversy isn’t a bug — it’s a feature. CEO Karp
          relishes the provocations; as he brags, the company is “comfortable
          being unpopular" and will gladly take projects that other tech giants
          shun for political reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it’s not just about war. Palantir’s reach now extends to health
          insurance companies (deploying AI to manage — or deny — claims), to
          for-profit hospital chains, to major investment banks, even to Wendy’s
          supply chain logistics. In 2024, their revenue approached $2.9
          billion, with 55% derived from government contracts, mostly with U.S.
          agencies.
        </p>

        <h2>The Pitch to Power: Becoming the Operating System of Government</h2>
        <p>
          Palantir has made its ambitions clear: it wants to be the software
          backbone — the operating system — of the entire U.S. government. In a
          2021 presentation, CTO Shyam Sankar declared the company’s mission as
          becoming “the US government’s central operating system,” extending
          their reach across defense, healthcare, and civilian agencies. Their
          sales pitch even reaches back into history, referencing the infamous
          “Last Supper” of 1993 — a secret meeting widely seen as the birth of
          the modern military-industrial complex. Palantir positions itself as
          the revolutionary force to upend the financialized, dividend-obsessed
          defense sector.
        </p>
        <p>
          This rhetoric works. In 2024, the Defense Innovation Board explicitly
          cited Palantir’s strategy in recommending greater investments in
          emerging technologies (i.e., Palantir’s core business). Their
          influence has grown so profound that the company was recently added to
          the S&amp;P 100, replacing Ford Motors, a testament to their
          ascendancy.
        </p>

        <h2>The Politicization of Data Power</h2>
        <p>
          Palantir’s elite connections don’t stop at contracts. The company is
          deeply tied to the corridors of Washington, especially during
          Republican administrations. Peter Thiel, a vocal supporter of Donald
          Trump, invested heavily in both the company and GOP campaigns. Former
          Palantir employees now occupy positions across government, from
          technology offices to strategic advisory roles. Palantir is uniquely
          positioned to fulfill the Trump administration’s aim of unifying and
          “streamlining” government databases.
        </p>
        <p>
          The implications are profound. For example, Palantir currently has
          contracts with the IRS, using their technology to sift through vast
          amounts of taxpayer data — flagging the easiest audits and possibly
          designing the next generation of pervasive tax oversight.{" "}
          <strong>Wired</strong> recently reported that Palantir is poised to
          provide unified software creating a “mega API” for the IRS,
          potentially giving select users access to — and power over — all
          taxpayer information in one place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Palantir is also embedded within the Department of Health and Human
          Services (HHS), landing contracts worth nearly $100 million to help
          manage core administrative data — including Medicare and Medicaid
          records and, by extension, sensitive health information for millions
          of Americans.
        </p>

        <h2>Governance by Algorithm, Not Democracy</h2>
        <p>
          What does it mean for a single tech contractor to control such a vast
          reservoir of private data, backed by AI decision-making? As algorithms
          increasingly govern daily realities, the human element recedes.
          Decisions formerly shaped by public scrutiny or democratic oversight
          become opaque, automated, and — perhaps most concerningly — aligned
          with the interests of those wielding the code rather than those being
          governed by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is not wild speculation. Palantir’s own leadership are
          transparent about these goals. Co-founder Peter Thiel once remarked,
          at a libertarian conference:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “We could never win an election on certain issues because we were
            always a small minority. But maybe you could actually unilaterally
            change the world…through technological means. Technology is an
            incredible alternative to politics.”
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Meanwhile, Alex Karp focuses on the details of data use and legality,
          arguing that oversight is key — but always with Palantir firmly in the
          oversight role.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “The central question of civil liberties isn’t if the government has
            data…but how it is used. Is it lawful? Is it being migrated into
            unauthorized places? If data is managed like this, you have the
            ultimate Silicon Valley solution.”
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          In short: one founder wants to shape the world through disruptive
          technology; the other demands their company supervise how government
          data is handled. Meanwhile, a unique share structure ensures neither
          can lose control: with “Class F” shares granting them nearly half of
          all Palantir voting power, even if they own just 6% of the stock.
        </p>

        <h2>The Stakes: Who Governs the Future?</h2>
        <p>
          This exposé began from a place of fear — fear of repercussions,
          pushback, or worse. But as the realities of Palantir’s sweeping
          ambitions become clear, the necessity of speaking out becomes obvious.{" "}
          <strong>
            Replacing a broken system with an even more unaccountable one,
            managed by the tech world’s most aggressive disruptors, is not the
            answer.
          </strong>{" "}
          The ever-present sense of being watched is itself an act of
          intimidation — a force that breeds public silence, not engagement.
        </p>

        <p>
          But, as the investigation concludes, the American public is more
          resilient and powerful than even Silicon Valley’s most influential
          titans. <strong>This is our country, and this is our future.</strong>
