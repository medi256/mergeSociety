        <p>
          What if I told you the <strong>computer science degree</strong> you’re
          studying so hard for might not be what actually gets you that dreamy
          $500K tech job—or even make you a good coder? The truth is, most of
          what you <em>think</em> you know about CS degrees is dead wrong. And
          if you’re not careful, you’ll end up missing the real chance everyone
          else is sleeping on. Here’s the explosive reality about computer
          science in 2025—what works, who wins, who wastes years, and how YOU
          can actually use it to dominate your career (even if the classes are
          useless).
        </p>

        {/* Section 1: The Great Salary Illusion */}
        <section>
          <h2>
            Shocking Truth: The Highest Tech Salaries Aren’t Where You Think
          </h2>
          <p>
            Forget what Google tells you. Forget what your college career fair
            pretends. Let’s destroy the myth together: The highest-paying jobs
            in tech aren’t at Google, Amazon, Apple, or Facebook anymore. The
            real money flows through elite quantitative trading firms—places
            like <strong>Citadel</strong>, <strong>Jane Street</strong>, and{" "}
            <strong>Two Sigma</strong>. These aren’t your ordinary coding gigs.
            We’re talking:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Citadel:</strong> Software engineer average salary of
              $250K. Total compensation—after stocks and bonuses—rockets to
              $500K+.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Jane Street:</strong> Total comp hovers around $480K.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Two Sigma:</strong> Almost every offer puts FAANG
              companies to shame.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Here’s the thing that blew my mind: <em>Everyone</em> assumes Google
            and Facebook pay the most. But look at leveled salary data or hop
            over to Levels.FYI—trading firms take the throne. Want to know the
            real reason? Trading firms take machine learning and high-frequency
            algorithm design to the extreme. Imagine the stock market as a
            roller coaster for the day. Their engineers are paid to find the
            lowest dips, buy, and sell at the highest peaks—sometimes every
            second. That’s why they want—and pay for—the best, and make you
            fight through brutally rigorous interviews.

          <h2>Chasing Startup Glory: Why Only 43% Make It (If You’re Lucky)</h2>
          <p>
            So maybe you want to skip the corporate grind and launch the next
            unicorn. Think again. Everyone races to places like{" "}
            <strong>Y Combinator</strong>, hungry for a $500K seed check at 7%
            equity—but here’s what nobody talks about:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Less than half (<strong>43%</strong>) of funded startups in the US
              actually use that money to create something valuable. Most burn
              through the cash, invest in the wrong things, or just… disappear.
            </li>
            <li>
              Even those who make it face brutal odds—over 60% of startups fail
              fast, sometimes before even hitting the market.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Most people screw this up by chasing the funding, not the product.
            But when you get it right? The results are insane.{" "}
            <strong>DoorDash</strong> exploded from a student startup (Stanford,
            2013) into a $12 billion behemoth with 1 billion+ fulfilled orders
            and over 1 million “Dashers.” (If you’re in India: think Zomato,
            Swiggy—the pattern is global.)

            Should You Chase a Computer Science PhD? Read This Before Deciding

          <p>
            You’re thinking about research—grad school, maybe even a PhD? Here’s
            what most students don’t realize:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Most undergrad/master’s “research” involves you grinding out
              papers… usually as cut-rate labor for your professor.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your PhD often benefits your mentor and boosts the university’s
              ranking more than it transforms your career.
            </li>
            <li>
              Research is the right path ONLY if you actually want to make
              research your life—professor track, Facebook/Google AI labs, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Bottom line:{" "}
            <em>
              If you only like the idea of research, don’t do it. If you burn
              for it, nothing else will satisfy.

            Does a Computer Science Degree Actually Matter? Only If You Do This…
          </h2>
          <p>
            Here’s where most people get it wrong. A computer science degree
            isn’t magic. It isn’t useless either. It’s exactly what you make of
            it.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The “Jordan shoe” paradox: Just like a Jordan shoe is just a shoe
              until you play in it—a CS degree is only “useful” if you put it to
              work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Most top students I met (myself included) didn’t obsess over
              grades. Their real goal?{" "}
              <strong>Internships, networking, projects</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The true value: Building a killer project portfolio. Connecting
              with classmates. Learning <em>how</em> to learn, not just ticking
              boxes.

          <p>
            So what’s the step-by-step here? How do you squeeze real value out
            of your degree, unlike 90% of students who drift through on
            autopilot?
          </p>

          <h3>Step 1: Forget GPA Obsession—Prioritize Real-World Results</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Don’t waste all your energy maxing out grades at the cost of
              everything else. That “A” in Theory of Computation doesn’t cut it
              if your GitHub is empty.
            </li>
            <li>
              Find internships STAT—even in first year. The harsh truth?{" "}
              <strong>Internship &gt; Class project &gt; Grades</strong> for
              almost every recruiter.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 2: Network Like a Pro (This Is Where Jobs Happen)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Your classmates today? They’re future founders, recruiters, hiring
              managers. Don’t be invisible—collaborate, help, code together.
            </li>
            <li>
              Connect with alumni, get involved in hackathons, and don’t be shy
              about DM’ing people for advice.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Step 3: Build, Build, Build: Projects Trump Everything</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Pick real problems and build actual solutions. Every project =
              potential talking point in interviews.
            </li>
            <li>
              Show off teamwork. Learning “how to learn” and “how to solve with
              a group” is the secret skill you’ll use forever.

            Why Most Computer Science Classes Are Outdated (And What To Do About
            It)
          </h2>
          <p>
            Here’s what nobody talks about: Most CS classes are dusty relics.
            Let me show you exactly what I mean:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Computer Networks:</strong> In the real world, you’ll be
              configuring NGINX, debugging load balancers—stuff your textbook
              never even mentions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Great theory, but you’ll
              rarely touch the kernel at work.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Machine Learning/AI:</strong> Unless you’re a dedicated
              researcher or data scientist, most ML/AI models are plug-and-play
              APIs now. You won’t code the algorithms from scratch.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            So, why does this happen? CS moves at hyper-speed. By the time a
            course textbook is printed, the industry already changed the rules.
            Schools can’t (or won’t) keep up.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            "If the knowledge isn’t evolving as fast as the tech, you’re already
            behind."
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            This is where most students screw up: They trust the syllabus
            blindly, and never bother learning the rapid-fire tools actually
            used on real jobs.

          <p>
            Listen carefully, because this changes everything: The classes might
            be outdated, but the <em>process</em> of learning, problem-solving,
            and collaborating—that’s gold. Senior engineers don’t care if you
            aced Data Structures 101. They want to know:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Can you solve real problems—fast?</li>
            <li>Can you adapt to fast-changing tools?</li>
            <li>Can you work well as a team?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you say “yes” to those, you’re already ahead of 90% of people who
            treat their degree like a box to tick. That’s the hidden key.

          </ul>
          <p>
            Let me say it again: Your CS degree is a multiplier only if you
            combine academics, real-world projects, internships, and relentless
            networking. Do that, and suddenly doors fly open—regardless of
            school “prestige.”
