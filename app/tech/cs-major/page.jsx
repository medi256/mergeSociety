        </h2>
        <p>
          In a world overflowing with bad news, economic hand wringing, and more
          layoffs than you’d care to count, sometimes you just need a breather.
          And what better way than asking the existential question:{" "}
          <strong>Should you study computer science?</strong> Inspired by the
          ever amusing “coding sloth” from YouTube (seriously, go check him out,
          like and subscribe), let’s take a deep, honest and only occasionally
          panicked dive into whether pursuing a computer science degree is worth
          it in 2025 and beyond.
        </p>

        <h2>The Tech Market, 2025: What Level Are You Playing?</h2>
        <p>
          Let’s get real: The tech job market isn’t <em>easy mode</em> right
          now. In fact, you might say it’s “veteran difficulty.” If you’re after
          one of those dreamy tech jobs, you basically have four main starting
          paths:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Recruit Difficulty:</strong> Your dad is the CEO. (Hey, if
            you can swing it!)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Regular:</strong> The average college computer science
            student. (This was me standard player mode!)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bootcamp:</strong> For those opting for crash course
            intensity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Veteran (Self taught):</strong> Massive respect, because
            let’s face it, almost everyone is self taught to <em>some</em>{" "}
            extent anyway.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Honestly, no matter what you pick, <strong>everyone</strong> is
          expected to navigate these veteran waters now. Even new grads from top
          universities are struggling to land jobs. Folks with “FANG” (Facebook,
          Amazon, Netflix, Google) on their resumes are getting ghosted. The
          struggle is real and if you take a peek at Reddit, well, let’s just
          say you’ll wish you hadn’t.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Why Breaking Into Tech Is Harder Than Beating Elden Ring (But Not
          Impossible)
        </h2>
        <p>
          Interviews are more brutal now, too. Forget just breezing through an
          “easy Leetcode” problem these days, the bar is set so high you might
          be asked to build the next Google in assembly language in ten minutes.
          Companies expect you to write algorithms that solve world hunger
          <em>and</em> explain them. But here’s some perspective: even{" "}
          <strong>before</strong> the 2022 tech slump and COVID, breaking in
          wasn’t a walk in the park. Landing that first internship or job drove
          many of us into “try hard” mode. Getting your first foot in the door
          is without exaggeration the hardest part. It gets exponentially easier
          after that.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, it’s not impossible. Coding projects, interview prep, and
          crucially <strong>networking</strong> can get you there. It’s a
          numbers game, driven mostly by effort... and, yes, a fair amount of
          luck. But you can (and should) shoot your shot.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Should You Study Computer Science? Let’s Get Real (And Maybe A Little
          Philosophical)
        </h2>
        <p>
          So, should you go all in on a computer science degree? If you’re
          reading this, you’re probably contemplating a life as an engineer
          sloth, web developer, or some flavor of builder in the tech universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Here’s the bottom line:</strong> A degree isn’t technically
          required for most jobs, but it does help you get in the door. Imagine
          two job candidates, both with no experience:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bob: Completed a three month bootcamp.</li>
          <li>Charlie: Self studied for a similar period.</li>
          <li>Chad: Holds a four year degree from a college.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Safe bet for recruiters? The degree holder. According to the 2025
          Stack Overflow survey (with input from over <strong>65,000</strong>{" "}
          developers!), about 66% have at least a bachelor’s or master’s.
          Surprisingly, it’s lower than many expect. Still, a degree gives you a
          better chance unless you’re one of those prodigies on Twitter building
          advanced operating systems in high school.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here’s some brutal honesty: plenty of folks with CS degrees can
          barely code. Cheating is rampant at many colleges. GPAs and degrees
          are just one metric and often don’t tell the whole story.
        </p>

        <h2>The Secret Path: Passion + Project Power</h2>
        <p>
          The most successful newcomers? They’re genuinely passionate. They
          don’t just sit in a closet coding all day; they network, showcase cool
          side projects, and actively participate in the community. You have to
          put yourself out there otherwise, no one will know how awesome you
          are, no matter your talent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on my own journey, after a year of post grad unemployment,
          I realized that networking and publicly sharing what you’re building
          are game changers.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here’s where the expectations vs. reality gap hits: Computer Science
          isn’t just about programming. Google defines it as{" "}
          <em>“the study of computation, information, and automation.”</em> So
          what does this mean for your coursework?
        </p>
        <p>
          Brace yourself for classes like discrete mathematics, automata theory,
          and operating systems. You’ll gain a deep theoretical foundation:
          algorithms, data structures, compsci theory, and the nitty gritty of
          how computers and compilers work. If you’re a theory nerd, you’ll love
          it. If you just want to make the next Minecraft mod or slick website,
          you may find yourself yawning.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Key difference:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Computer Science:</strong> Deep dive into theories,
            algorithms, computational structures, and the inner workings of a
            computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Software Engineering:</strong> The hands on application of
            these concepts to actually <em>build</em> things software, apps,
            products.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Sure, theory can help you flex your brain (and maybe design the
          world’s best DoorDash routing algorithm), but it isn’t as directly
          “practical projects” focused as you might expect.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Bother With Theory? Understanding The Value of a CS Degree</h2>
        <p>
          Even if you forget 90% of that theory, the exposure means you’ll have
          a fuzzy but crucial understanding of how computers tick a skill that
          pays off when you hit weird bugs or need to troubleshoot obscure Java
          thread pool issues at work (speaking from experience here).
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, at big companies like Google, you’re expected to{" "}
          <strong>learn continually</strong>. If you’re a one trick pony (“I
          only do frontend!”), get ready to pivot new languages, new concepts,
          backend, frontend, machine learning. You’re paid to learn on the fly.
          That’s why learning <strong>how to learn</strong> might be the most
          important skill of all.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Fact: Most developers (about 82%, according to Stack Overflow) use
            online resources as their <b>primary</b> way to learn.
          </em>{" "}
          “YouTube University” is real so yes, you’ll be self teaching long
          after you leave the lecture hall. Actual “on the job training” is rare
          (contrary to HR promises), and if you’re lucky enough to have helpful
          colleagues, that’s a bonus.
        </p>

        <h2>Is College a Scam? (Let’s Vent For A Minute)</h2>
        <p>
          There’s legitimate frustration about paying tens of thousands for mass
          lectures and being told to “figure it out yourself” while better
          videos are available on YouTube <strong>for free</strong>. Bootcamps
          can be hit or miss, and overpriced “quick fix” courses abound. Truth
          is, you mostly learn by <strong>doing</strong>. With professors
          providing minimal guidance and large courses moving at a rigid pace,
          many students feel self study could be faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, why even bother with a CS degree? It comes down to{" "}
          <strong>opportunity</strong>. The best part of being a student isn’t
          always the content it’s the unique access you get:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Internships:</strong> Spend a summer at a real company. It’s
            easier to land these as a student, interviews are (sometimes) less
            intimidating, and a solid performance may land you a return offer.
            (Though some companies, like Google, make you re interview anyway…)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Research positions:</strong> These are great if you want
            resume experience or are aiming for grad school. Easier to land than
            most internships, and you just need to ask professors for a spot on
            their research projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hackathons:</strong> Build cool stuff, meet people, and
            stand out from the crowd.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Admittedly, you’ll need to <strong>touch grass</strong> (socialize)
          not a favorite activity for many CS majors! But these opportunities
          make a measurable difference in landing jobs and building your
          confidence.
        </p>

        <h2>The Realities Of Professors, Reddit, and Weird Research Emails</h2>
        <p>
          Not all professors are nice some research supervisors demand 20
          volunteer hours a week, super detailed progress reports, and threaten
          to “fire” you and broadcast your poor performance to every other prof
          if you slip up. Yes, that’s based on a real (and frankly hilarious)
          Reddit message.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “If you do not perform, I will fire you and share a performance report
          with other professors… My time is more important than yours. Good
          luck.”
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          That’s harsh, but don’t let it discourage you from approaching
          professors for opportunities most aren’t quite that intense!
        </p>

        <h2>So… Will AI Replace All Software Engineers Tomorrow?</h2>
        <p>
          Enter the next tech boogeyman: <strong>AI</strong>. Will DevinAI
          replace us all? Is it time to give up and sell burgers instead?
        </p>
        <p>The 2025 Stack Overflow survey reveals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            70% of <strong>professional developers</strong> don’t see AI as a
            job threat (yet).
          </li>
          <li>
            81% say AI boosts productivity the smart ones are using it already!
          </li>
          <li>
            82% use AI tools to write code in daily work. And that number is
            rising.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          AI assistance is quickly becoming a must have skill for developers,
          but it’s not about to wipe out all jobs overnight. Yes, it means the
          bar is higher, but it also means you have more tools to work smarter,
          faster, and learn new tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to upskill, there are AI specific courses now (check the
          coding sloth’s channel for one on Coursera), but remember: human
          problem solving and adaptability still matter most.
        </p>

        <h2>The (Humorous, Honest) Final Verdict</h2>
        <p>
          Should you study computer science? Well, if you want to pad your
          resume, gain a deep understanding of the fundamentals, and open doors
          to key opportunities like internships and research,{" "}
          <strong>it’s still a solid path</strong> as long as you know you’ll be
          self studying a lot of practical skills on your own.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re deeply passionate, love learning, and aren’t afraid to touch
          grass (or at least, network online), there’s a market for genuinely
          skilled people who show what they can build. And, yes, even if you
          don’t have a degree, it will be harder but not impossible with
          dedication and luck.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, whether you’re Team Chad (degree), Team Bob (bootcamp), or
          Team Charlie (self taught), what sets you apart is{" "}
          <strong>
            initiative, persistence, and the willingness to keep learning
            forever
          </strong>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          “Bro, just put my fries in the bag.” But if you decide to become a
          coding sloth well, welcome to the jungle. Hopefully, this guide helps
          you make your choice with open eyes and maybe, just maybe, a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Computer science makes you well rounded and
          opens doors but doesn’t teach everything you’ll need. Prepare to self
          study, network hard, build cool stuff, and never stop learning no
          matter how you start.
