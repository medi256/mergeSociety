        <p>
          Imagine you stumble on a short movie script where a person is chatting
          with their AI assistant. You can read every line the person says. But
          right when the AI is about to reply, the page is torn off. What would
          the assistant have said next? If you had a magical machine that could
          read text and guess the next word in the sequence, you could finish
          the scene. You would feed the dialogue into this machine, let it
          predict the first word of the AI's reply, then the next, then the
          next, watching the answer unfold one word at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is exactly what a chatbot does. The magic looks like fiction when
          you see it as a movie scene, but underneath, it is a very particular
          kind of math, a very large function with an appetite for patterns, and
          a very serious amount of computation. Let me walk you through it in
          the precise order it actually works, so the whole picture clicks into
          place.

          <h2>The Movie Script Thought Experiment</h2>
          <p>
            Let us sit with that torn-off script for a moment. You have a
            dialogue where a person asks a question, maybe something specific
            like how to fix a leaky faucet, or maybe something more open-ended
            like why the sky is blue. The scene is vivid in your head. The
            lighting, the pause before a reply, the expectation that the
            assistant will answer helpfully. The only problem is that the
            assistant’s reply is missing. It is an empty beat begging to be
            completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now imagine you own a machine that, given any text, can tell you
            what word most plausibly comes next. This machine does not care
            about the plot or the characters. It only cares about sequences and
            the next step in those sequences. You pass the user’s line into it,
            and it gives you a probability distribution over all possible next
            words. Maybe it thinks “Sure,” is likely. Maybe “Here’s” is even
            more likely. You pick one, add it to the script, then ask again for
            the next word, and the next. Before long, the answer is filled in.
            The reply sounds coherent because each word flowed from the previous
            context.
          </p>
          <p>
            Read that process slowly and you will notice that the machine is not
            writing an answer in one go. It is predicting one word at a time,
            repeatedly, and the growing text becomes its own context. That is
            not just a useful analogy. That is literally what is happening each
            time you interact with a modern chatbot.
          </p>

          <h2>
            From Autocomplete to a Conversation: What a Large Language Model
            Really Is
          </h2>
          <p>
            A large language model is a sophisticated mathematical function that
            takes in some text and outputs probabilities for what word should
            come next. Think of it like a huge weighted web that lights up
            differently depending on the words you feed it. It does not just
            point to one word with certainty. Instead it assigns a probability
            to every possible next word in its vocabulary. If the context is
            “peanut butter and,” then “jelly” might get a very high probability,
            while “galaxy” might get a tiny one, though still nonzero.
          </p>
          <p>
            To build a chatbot, we structure the input text to look like a
            conversation. We write a little system preface that describes an
            interaction between a user and a helpful AI assistant. Then we
            append whatever the user actually types as the first part of that
            dialogue. The model is asked to predict the next word that the
            assistant would say in response. After the first word is chosen, the
            model is asked again with the updated context. The process repeats,
            and the assistant’s answer streams out one token at a time.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a subtle trick that makes the output feel more natural. If
            you always pick the single most likely next word, you get stiff,
            repetitive prose. Real language has quirks, detours, and a bit of
            surprise. So during generation, we let the model sometimes pick less
            likely words at random, guided by the probabilities it assigns. You
            can picture it like reaching into a weighted bag where common words
            are heavy marbles and rare words are light ones. You usually pull a
            heavy marble, but now and then a lighter one slips out, and that
            keeps the voice lively.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is an odd twist. Even though the model itself is deterministic,
            meaning the underlying function gives the same probabilities for the
            same input, the sampling process introduces randomness. So the same
            prompt will often yield different answers on different runs. That
            wiggle room is a feature, not a bug. It helps with creativity, it
            helps avoid getting stuck in a single phrasing, and it makes the
            assistant feel human without pretending to be human.

          <h2>How Models Learn: Training on a Mountain of Text</h2>
          <p>
            Models learn how to make these predictions by processing an enormous
            amount of text, usually pulled from the public internet along with
            licensed sources. When I say enormous, I do not mean a big
            bookshelf. I mean a body of text that would flatten a reader. For a
            standard human to read the amount used to train GPT-3, if they read
            nonstop, no breaks, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, the journey would
            take more than 2,600 years. That is not a typo. Two thousand six
            hundred years of continuous reading, and that was a model from years
            ago. Larger models since then train on much, much more.
          </p>
          <p>
            What does learning look like inside the model? Picture a machine
            with a mind-bending number of dials, knobs, and sliders. Each dial
            represents one continuous value inside the model. These values are
            called parameters or weights. The way the model behaves is entirely
            determined by where those dials are set. Turn a few and the model
            gets better at grammar. Turn a different cluster and it starts to
            pick up on style. With hundreds of billions of these parameters, the
            machine has a huge capacity to encode patterns about language.
          </p>
          <p>
            No human sits there and sets these parameters. The model begins at
            random, which means at the start it outputs gibberish. It has no
            idea what words go together. There is no concept of subject-verb
            agreement, no knowledge that “cat” and “cats” are related, no notion
            of world facts. All of that is learned. The learning happens by
            showing the model example after example where it is challenged to
            predict the next word. Then we score how well it did and nudge all
            the dials to make the right answer a little more likely next time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each training example can be short, like a handful of words, or
            long, like thousands of tokens. The mechanics are always the same.
            We pass in all but the last word from the example. The model outputs
            a probability distribution for what the last word might be. We
            compare that distribution against the true last word from the
            example. Where it got things wrong, an algorithm called
            backpropagation computes how to tweak the parameters so that the
            model becomes slightly more likely to choose the true word and
            slightly less likely to choose all the others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do this not just for a few examples, but for many trillions of them.
            The model starts by flailing and missing obvious answers. Over time,
            it makes fewer blunders. Then it starts to generalize. Not only does
            it become accurate on the training examples, it gets good at
            predicting text it has never seen before. It learns grammar from
            repetition. It learns idioms from context. It learns that “bank” can
            mean money or river, and that the surrounding words resolve the
            ambiguity.

          <h2>Mind-Boggling Compute: A 100 Million Year Thought Experiment</h2>
          <p>
            The scale of computation involved in training a large language model
            is hard to wrap your head around. Let us try anyway with a mental
            experiment. Imagine that you, personally, could perform 1 billion
            additions and multiplications every single second. You are basically
            a superhero calculator with perfect focus. How long would it take
            you to perform all the operations needed to train the largest
            language models we build today?
          </p>
          <p>
            Would it be a year? That already sounds wild. Would it be something
            like 10,000 years? That feels like geologic time. The answer is
            actually much more than that. It is well over 100 million years of
            nonstop arithmetic at that blistering personal pace. That is the
            kind of raw computational work that goes into tuning those hundreds
            of billions of parameters. It gives you a sense of why this field
            depends so heavily on specialized hardware and huge, coordinated
            compute clusters.
          </p>

          <h2>
            Pretraining vs Being Helpful: Why We Add Reinforcement Learning With
            Human Feedback
          </h2>
          <p>
            Everything I have described so far is called pretraining. The goal
            during pretraining is simple. Autocomplete text from the internet.
            That objective teaches the model syntax, style, facts, and patterns.
            But it is not the same objective as being a good AI assistant. The
            internet contains plenty of passages that are unhelpful, off-topic,
            or worse. If you only trained on that objective, your assistant
            would often be clever but not aligned with what users want.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we add another step called reinforcement learning with human
            feedback. Humans read model outputs and flag which ones are helpful,
            honest, and safe, and which ones are not. They suggest better
            answers when something feels off. Their judgments are used to
            further change the model’s parameters. In other words, we take the
            raw predictive ability learned from pretraining and we refine it so
            the assistant is more likely to give predictions that people
            actually prefer in a conversation setting.
          </p>
          <p>
            This does not mean the model suddenly reasons like a person. It
            still predicts words. But that prediction process gets a new nudge
            from human preferences. If two plausible outputs exist, and one is
            curt while the other is helpful, the training shifts probability
            mass toward the helpful one. Over many rounds of this, the
            assistant’s tone and behavior shift toward what users expect when
            they ask for help.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Why GPUs Matter, and Why Parallelization Changed Everything</h2>
          <p>
            Given the staggering amount of computation in pretraining, this all
            only works because we use special chips called GPUs. GPUs are
            designed to run many operations in parallel. Instead of doing one
            addition then the next, they do thousands or millions at once. This
            parallelism matches the math behind deep learning, which is mostly
            big matrix multiplications and element-wise operations that can be
            spread across lots of cores.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is the catch. Not all language models can be easily
            parallelized over sequences. Before 2017, many models processed text
            one word at a time from left to right. That sequential dependency
            makes training slow because you have to wait for one step to finish
            before starting the next. You can still parallelize across examples
            in a batch, but not across positions in a single example, so a long
            sentence becomes a long wait.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then a team of researchers at Google introduced a new architecture
            known as the Transformer. The key idea is simple to say and powerful
            in practice. Transformers do not read text strictly from start to
            finish. They soak in the whole sequence at once, in parallel, and
            let different parts of the input directly influence each other. That
            change unlocked huge efficiency gains and made it practical to train
            on much longer contexts with much more compute humming in parallel.

          <h2>
            Inside a Transformer: Vectors, Attention, and Feedforward Networks
          </h2>
          <p>
            Let us walk cleanly through what a transformer does with text. The
            very first step is to turn each word or token into a long list of
            numbers. You can think of this list as a vector, an array that sits
            in a high-dimensional space. The training process only works with
            continuous values. So we need to encode language as numbers. These
            vectors are learned during training so that tokens with related
            meanings end up with related vectors. That way, math on vectors can
            mirror relationships in meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            What makes transformers special is their reliance on an operation
            called attention. Attention lets each token’s vector look around at
            other tokens in the sequence and ask, who should I care about for
            this context, and by how much? All those vectors get a chance to
            talk to one another and refine what they encode, in parallel. If the
            word is “bank,” attention looks at neighbors like “river” or “loan”
            to decide which sense is relevant. The numbers for “bank” shift so
            that the vector prioritizes the right meaning for that instance.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is another ingredient in each layer called a feedforward
            neural network. This is a small, independent network that takes the
            refined vector and transforms it through a few more learned
            nonlinear steps. You can think of attention as mixing information
            across positions, and the feedforward part as processing that
            information at each position to store useful patterns. The two
            operations together give the model the capacity to soak up
            structure, style, and facts over training.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practice, a transformer has many layers stacked on top of one
            another. The data repeatedly flows through attention and feedforward
            blocks, again and again. With each pass, the vectors become more
            enriched with context. Early layers might focus on local grammar.
            Later layers might capture long-range dependencies, topic structure,
            and subtle cues that matter for a good next-word prediction.
            Everything is tuned so that, by the time we get to the end of the
            stack, the model has what it needs to pick the next word wisely.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>From Enriched Vectors to a Next-Word Probability</h2>
          <p>
            After the sequence has moved through all those layers, we take the
            last vector in the sequence, the one that now encodes the context of
            the input and everything the model has learned. We apply one final
            transformation to turn that vector into a probability distribution
            over the entire vocabulary. The output does not say, the answer is
            this word. It says, here is how likely each possible next word is,
            given everything so far.
          </p>
          <p>
            Researchers design the framework for each step. We choose that there
            will be attention, that there will be feedforward layers, that the
            model will be trained to predict the next token. But the specific
            behavior is an emergent phenomenon from how those hundreds of
            billions of parameters settle during training. That is why it is so
            challenging to say exactly why the model chose one particular
            phrasing over another. We can point to patterns and sometimes
            interpret parts of the network, but on the whole, the behavior
            emerges rather than being hand-coded.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Why The Outputs Feel So Fluent</h2>
          <p>
            When you use a large language model to autocomplete a prompt, the
            words it generates often feel uncannily fluent. You get sentences
            that flow, paragraphs that stay on theme, and references that make
            sense. That happens because the model has seen so many examples of
            how people write, ask, and explain. It has learned the rhythms and
            transitions that make text readable. It has also learned that good
            answers are not just correct but shaped for the reader’s
            expectation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes the outputs are more than just fluent. They are
            fascinating or downright useful. The model can combine patterns from
            different domains, navigate ambiguity, and show you a framing you
            had not considered. That pairing of fluency and usefulness is why
            this technology feels like magic when you first see it, even though
            underneath it is a mountain of statistics, a sea of vectors, and a
            lot of multiply-and-add.

          <h2>If You Want More on Transformers and Attention</h2>
          <p>
            If you are a new viewer and you are curious about more details on
            how transformers and attention work, boy, do I have some material
            for you. One option is to jump into a series I made about deep
            learning where we visualize and motivate the details of attention
            and all the other steps in a transformer. In that series, I go frame
            by frame through the math and the intuition, showing how the pieces
            click together. You will see how the vectors move, how the weights
            change, and why the architecture is built the way it is. It is
            designed so that you can feel the computations, not just read
            formulas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, on my second channel, I just posted a talk that I gave a
            couple months ago about this topic for the company TNG in Munich.
            The vibe of a talk is different from a produced video. There is a
            bit of live energy, some off-the-cuff clarifications, and a pacing
            that follows the audience’s curiosity. I sometimes prefer that
            format because it lets me linger where people naturally have
            questions and speed past what is already clear. If you want the
            subject to feel conversational and grounded, that talk might be your
            thing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will leave it up to you which one feels like the better follow on.
            If you like polished visuals and carefully staged animations, the
            produced series is a great path. If you prefer the flow of a casual
            walkthrough with a room full of people nodding along, take the
            Munich talk for a spin. Either way, you will come away with the
            inner picture that makes transformers and attention feel tangible
            instead of mysterious.

          <h3>What To Picture When I Say “Look at this”</h3>
          <p>
            Sometimes I gesture to visuals like diagrams of attention or stacks
            of transformer layers. Since you are reading this, here is how to
            translate those gestures into mental images:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              For the script thought experiment: imagine a screenplay page with
              a highlighted cursor appearing after the user’s line. Each
              predicted word pops in as if typed by an invisible hand.
            </li>
            <li>
              For probabilities over next words: picture a horizontal bar chart
              where “jelly” towers above “galaxy” when you type “peanut butter
              and.” Bars jiggle as context changes.
            </li>
            <li>
              For parameters: visualize a wall covered with an absurd number of
              sliders. Training nudges them, sometimes by a hair’s breadth,
              across many rounds.
            </li>
            <li>
              For GPUs and parallelism: think of thousands of conveyor belts
              moving in sync, each carrying blocks that get multiplied, added,
              and passed along.
            </li>
            <li>
              For attention: imagine each word shining a beam toward other words
              it deems relevant. The brightness of the beam shows how much it
              pays attention.
            </li>
            <li>
              For the final prediction: see a roulette wheel with wedges sized
              by probability. The ball almost always lands on a big wedge, but
              sometimes a small wedge wins and keeps the text interesting.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </aside>

        <section>
          <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
          <p>
            Let us tie the threads. A chatbot is a next-word prediction engine
            trained on a staggering corpus, refined with human feedback, and
            powered by architectures that let it process context in parallel.
            You give it a prompt shaped like a dialogue. It predicts one word at
            a time, with a bit of randomness to keep things lively, and it
            streams out an answer that reads like it was composed in one
            sitting.
          </p>
          <p>
            The parameters start random. Backpropagation tunes them over
            trillions of examples until the model generalizes to new text it has
            never seen. The compute bill is huge, which is why GPUs and
            parallelization are not just nice to have but essential.
            Transformers make that parallelization practical by letting tokens
            pay attention to each other directly instead of waiting in a line.
          </p>
          <p>
            Researchers design the scaffolding. The behavior emerges from how
            the parameters settle. That is why specific predictions can be hard
            to explain in mechanistic detail, and also why the results can feel
            fluent, fascinating, and useful in practice. If this piqued your
            curiosity, the deep learning series and the TNG Munich talk give you
            two paths to see the machinery up close. Pick the style that fits
            you best, and enjoy watching the pieces lock into place.
          </p>

        <p>
          Thanks for reading. If you want to keep going, explore the attention
          visuals, try the talk, or reread the movie script thought experiment
          and notice how your mental model sharpened. Once you see chatbots as
          next-word predictors with very smart training, the whole field feels
          less like magic and more like a clear set of ideas you can hold in
          your head.
