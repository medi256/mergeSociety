          <strong>By Okus, Technical Recruiter at Google</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          Curious what it’s really like to sit through a technical interview at
          Google? In this article, we’ll dive deep into a mock interview
          session, spotlighting two software engineers—one in the role of
          interviewer, the other as the candidate—working through a classic
          coding problem. While you won’t get this exact question in your own
          interview, this scenario showcases the types of challenges Google uses
          to evaluate candidates for problem-solving ability, technical skill,
          and communication.
        </p>

        <h2>Meet the Participants</h2>
        <p>
          The interview kicks off with <strong>Okus</strong>, a technical
          recruiter from Google, introducing the exercise. The candidate for
          this session is <strong>Sami</strong>, a research scientist at Google
          Research, who gamely steps into the hot seat. Across the virtual table
          is <strong>Juliana</strong>, a software engineer at YouTube, ready to
          play the role of the interviewer.
        </p>

              during your interview, so practice writing code with Google Docs.
              Try to do it at home. Write code, make sure your code is tested.
              Do this process before you come to the interview. And don’t worry
              about small syntax errors like which substring to use for a given
              method. Just pick one like start-end or start-length and let your
              interviewer know.”

        <h2>The Problem: Finding the Largest Square of Good Land</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Juliana:</strong>{" "}
          <em>“So Sami, here’s my technical question for you.”</em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Imagine a farmer looking to maximize the area of good land to farm.
          The farmer’s land is plotted as a matrix of ones and zeros: ones
          signify good land, zeros signify bad land. The challenge is to find
          the largest possible area of good land that can be farmed, with the
          restriction that the farmed area must form a <strong>square</strong>
          —not a rectangle.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>
            “Please help the farmer to find the maximum area of the land they
            can farm in good land.”
          </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          Juliana shares a written version of the problem statement and an
          example matrix. Sami takes a moment to read and analyze the prompt,
          starting as most effective candidates do: by seeking clarification.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Clarifying Assumptions: <em>“Square or Rectangle?”</em>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Sami:</strong> “Must it be a square, the area they want to
          farm, or could it be a rectangle?”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Juliana:</strong> “For this problem, we only want a square.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Open-ended questions aren't just
            about the code—they're about clear thinking. Stating and checking
            your assumptions is crucial, especially as many interview problems
            at Google are deliberately open to interpretation.
          </em>
        </p>

        <h2>Thinking Aloud: Brute Force Approaches Explained</h2>
        <p>
          Sami begins with a "brute force" approach, fully narrating his logic.
        </p>
        <p>Imagine traversing each cell of the input matrix. For each cell:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Start another two loops to examine every possible square originating
            at that cell.
          </li>
          <li>
            First verify you can form a 1x1 square. Then try a 2x2, a 3x3, and
            so on, as long as all the relevant cells contain ones.
          </li>
          <li>Keep track of the biggest square found so far.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Visualizing this, for any index (i, j) in the matrix, Sami describes
          expanding outward—first to the right, then downward, ensuring every
          cell in the growing square is a one. If the next expansion reaches a
          zero, that square size is not possible from that starting cell.
        </p>

        <div style={{ borderRadius: "8px", border: "2px" }}>
          <h3>Step-by-Step, the Brute Force in Action:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Start at (i, j). Check if it's a one.</li>
            <li>
              If yes, try expanding to all positions to create a 2x2 square
              (check cells at (i+1, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j+1)).
            </li>
            <li>
              If all are ones, try a 3x3, 4x4, etc., updating the maximum when a
              larger square is found.
            </li>
            <li>Repeat this for every cell in the matrix.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            <strong>But what’s the catch?</strong> This approach has a
            computational complexity of O(n<sup>4</sup>)—clearly inefficient for
            large datasets.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Sami confirms that it's not ideal, and Juliana agrees, nudging him to
          consider a more efficient method.
        </p>

        <h2>Recursion: A Top-Down Perspective</h2>
        <p>Next, Sami explores a recursive approach. The core insight:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For every cell containing a one, ask recursively, “How large of a
            square can we generate using the current cell as the top-left
            corner?”
          </li>
          <li>Ignore (return 0) whenever a zero is encountered.</li>
          <li>
            For a one, recursively call to the right, downward, and diagonal
            cells (i.e., (i, j+1), (i+1, j), and (i+1, j+1)), and take the{" "}
            <strong>minimum</strong> of their square sizes.
          </li>
          <li>
            The base case: for any zero, return 0. For cells on the bottom or
            right boundary, the largest square is 1 (if they are ones), as they
            cannot extend further.
          </li>
          <li>
            The result at each position is{" "}
            <code>1 + min(down, right, diagonal)</code>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Sami and Juliana collaboratively validate the correctness of this
          method using diagrams (described verbally in the interview). If three
          neighbor cells can each form a 3x3 square, their shared “parent” cell
          can form a 4x4—provided its own value is a one.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Pro Tip: <strong>Memoization</strong> can be added here to store
            interim results and avoid repeated computation. This improves time
            complexity to O(n*m).
          </em>
        </p>

        <h2>Dynamic Programming: The Bottom-Up Method</h2>
        <p>
          Finally, Sami describes how to convert the recursive approach into a
          bottom-up <strong>dynamic programming (DP)</strong> solution, which is
          considered optimal for this class of problems.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Initialize a DP matrix of the same size as the input, filled with
            zeros.
          </li>
          <li>
            For each cell in the input:
            <ul>
              <li>
                If the input cell is a zero, update the corresponding DP cell to
                zero (or leave as zero).
              </li>
              <li>
                If the input cell is a one, look at the left (
                <code>dp[i][j-1]</code>), top (<code>dp[i-1][j]</code>), and
                top-left diagonal (<code>dp[i-1][j-1]</code>) DP values. The new
                DP value is <code>1 + min(left, top, diagonal)</code>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            At each step, keep track of the maximum value found in the DP
            matrix. This represents the <strong>side length</strong> of the
            largest square.
          </li>
          <li>
            At the end, return <code>max_side_length * max_side_length</code> as
            the area.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Juliana points out an important subtlety: the DP array holds the{" "}
          <strong>side length</strong> of the largest square at each location,
          not the area. Since the problem requires area, remember to square the
          side length before returning the result.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sami:</strong> Should I start programming the dynamic solution
          and explain as I go?
          <br />
          <strong>Juliana:</strong> That sounds great!
        </p>

        <pre>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="java" style={docco}>
            {`def largest_square(bin_array: List[List[int]]) -> int:
      if not bin_array or not bin_array[0]:
          return 0
      n, m = len(bin_array), len(bin_array[0])
      dp = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
      max_side = 0
      for i in range(n):
          for j in range(m):
              if bin_array[i][j] == 1:
                  if i == 0 or j == 0:
                      dp[i][j] = 1
                  else:
                      dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])
                  max_side = max(max_side, dp[i][j])
      return max_side * max_side
  `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </pre>

        <p>
          As Sami codes, he talks through every step, considering edge
          conditions (like cells in the first row or column that can't look
          “backward”), optimizing to avoid redundant computations, and making
          the code clear and resilient.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also discusses optimizations, such as tracking the maximum inside
          the main loop instead of a separate pass and possible further
          improvements for cleaner syntax.

        <h2>What Makes a Strong Google Interview Performance?</h2>
        <p>
          This in-depth session illustrates the key characteristics Google
          interviewers look for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Communication:</strong> Clearly explaining your thought
            process as you go is just as important as finding the right answer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Questioning Assumptions:</strong> Ask clarifying questions
            early; open-ended problems require that you define boundaries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Iterative Improvement:</strong> Start with brute force, then
            discuss efficiency improvements—a path many interviewers want to
            see.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Attention to Detail:</strong> Proactively handle edge cases
            and be explicit about performance and correctness.
          </li>
        </ul>
