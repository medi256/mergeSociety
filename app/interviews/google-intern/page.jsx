        </h2>

        <p>
          Landing a job as a software engineer at Google is a feat more
          difficult than getting into Harvard—less than 1% of all applicants
          actually receive an offer. Most aspiring engineers believe the key to
          success is grinding through hundreds of LeetCode problems, but the
          reality is more nuanced. You’ll find countless stories of people who
          solved 300, 400, or even 500 coding questions, only to stumble and
          fall in the real interview.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, what’s missing from their preparation? Let’s break it down with a
          familiar scenario: Remember that big exam where you knew the answer to
          a question, but your mind blanked out until you stepped out of the
          classroom? That frustrating disconnect is exactly what torpedoes many
          highly-prepared candidates during technical interviews. Whether you’re
          a beginner learning code or a seasoned developer, there’s a secret
          framework you need—a practical approach that will get you unstuck and
          boost your confidence, no matter what interview hurdle comes your way.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the heart of this framework are three crucial stages:{" "}
          <strong>
            planning your code, writing your code, and explaining your code.
          </strong>
           Mastering each stage is vital not just for communicating your
          solution, but for showing that you can organize thoughts clearly—the
          skill that separates great candidates from average ones.
        </p>

        <h2>Stage 1: Planning Your Code</h2>

        <p>
          The first—and perhaps most overlooked—step in nailing a coding
          interview is <strong>effective planning</strong>. We can break this
          down into two main components: <strong>clarifying the problem</strong>{" "}
          and <strong>explaining your algorithm</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>Clarifying the Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Imagine yourself nervously signing on to a Zoom interview. The
          interviewer joins and outlines the coding problem you need to tackle.
          It may be tempting to jump straight into writing code or to make a
          quick guess at the solution. Don’t! If you misunderstand the problem
          or work on the wrong task, you’re setting yourself up for an immediate
          rejection.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, take a breath and <strong>clarify the problem</strong>. This
          starts with providing your own sample inputs and outputs. For example,
          if you're asked to reverse a string, state a test case out loud: “If
          the input is ‘abc’, the output should be ‘cba’—is that correct?” This
          confirms your understanding and demonstrates strong communication
          skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next, probe further by asking about at least three edge cases.
          Consider things like the size of the input, how to handle negative
          numbers, or empty arrays. This not only shows you’re a thorough
          problem-solver, it also helps you spot any tricky scenarios before you
          get blindsided. Once you’ve nailed down the problem definition, you’re
          ready to discuss <strong>how</strong> to solve it.
        </p>

        <h3>Explaining Your Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          Here’s a common pitfall: leaping directly to the most optimal, elegant
          solution. After months of LeetCode prep, it’s easy to get caught in
          the trap of perfection. But, ironically, this can work against you.
          The real trick is to <strong>start simple</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Propose a straightforward, even naive approach first. For instance, if
          the problem could be solved with either a linear or binary search,
          start by discussing the linear approach—“Should I try linear search
          first to validate the problem before optimizing?” You might be
          surprised: sometimes, the interviewer is only looking for a working
          solution!
        </p>
        <p>
          If they signal that a more advanced answer is needed, only then
          proceed to optimize. And if you’re struggling to instantly recall the
          best algorithm, honestly assess whether more practice is what you
          need, or if it’s just nerves talking. For those still building the
          basics, the widely recommended “LeetCode 75” list is the perfect
          starting point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all, when formulating your solution, say you’re dropping
          restrictions or tackling a simpler case first—make this explicit. Walk
          the interviewer through test cases and potential algorithms. This not
          only clarifies your thought process but also invites the interviewer
          to collaborate and offer guidance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you’ve identified your approach,{" "}
          <strong>
            write down your algorithm in comments or as bullet points in your
            editor
          </strong>
          . Outline the data structures you plan to use and which algorithms
          will get you from input to answer. Narrate your thought process as you
          do this and check with your interviewer for questions or feedback. If
          they’re on board, you’re cleared to begin coding!
        </p>

        <h2>Stage 2: Writing Your Code</h2>

        <p>
          Now, as you jump into writing code, project confidence. In this phase,
          interviewers generally won’t interject—they want to see how you
          translate ideas into working code, and how closely you stick to your
          outline. Their focus? Your <strong>communication</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>coding efficiency</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here’s a real anecdote to drive the point home: I once interviewed a
          master’s student with several impressive internships behind him. He
          nailed the outline, identified the optimal algorithm, and clearly
          articulated his plan. Then, as soon as he started typing, he went
          silent—totally focused on the code. Even though he got stuck parsing a
          string, he persisted and finished in time. I gave him a pass for his
          problem-solving, but the other interviewers didn’t. Their reason? He
          didn’t communicate enough after the planning stage.
        </p>

        <h3>Tips for Communicating While Coding</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Talk as you code:</strong> Even a running commentary of your
            actions helps (“Now I’m sorting the array to find the largest
            element. I’ll use a standard library sort. Once sorted, I’ll return
            the last element.”).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>If multitasking is tough, alternate:</strong> Briefly
            explain what you plan to code next, tie it to your earlier outline,
            then code it silently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Highlight code choices:</strong> Reference variable names,
            data structures, or notable logic to keep the interviewer engaged in
            your process.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Efficiency—how quickly and clearly you write code—matters too. Choose
          good variable names and aim for readable, logically organized code.
          But here’s a universal truth:{" "}
          <strong>everyone gets stuck somewhere</strong>. Whether it’s a bizarre
          error, a tricky function, or an unexpected edge case, how you react
          could make or break your interview.
        </p>

        <h3>How to Handle Getting Stuck</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Don’t waste precious time:</strong> If stumped, leave a
            brief <code>// TODO</code> in your code and move on to the next part
            of your algorithm. You can always return to these mini roadblocks if
            time permits.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>For minor checks (like null validation):</strong> Mark them
            as <code>// TODO: null check</code>. More often than not,
            interviewers don’t require exhaustive edge handling in a 30–45
            minute window—but if they do, address them at the end.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Stage 3: Explaining Your Code — Prove It, Optimize It, or Both</h2>

        <p>
          As you finish, realize the interviewer is now assessing your
          “level”—are you a junior who’s just scrambling to get code working, or
          a future senior who can explain, optimize, and teach? The difference?
          Proactive, clear explanation.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well
            enough.” — Albert Einstein
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          When your code is written, you face a fork in the road: Should you
          test your solution or work on optimizing it further? Here’s a simple
          fix—just <strong>ask your interviewer</strong> what they want to see
          next.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>If asked to optimize:</strong> Revisit your code. Identify
            and circle (figuratively or with notes) the{" "}
            <strong>bottleneck</strong>
            —the section where your runtime is highest. Communicate each part’s
            Big O complexity, then propose and explain improvements. This shows
            advanced reasoning and technical mastery.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>If your solution is accepted:</strong> Prove your code! Pick
            a realistic test case (ideally one of the simple inputs or edge
            cases discussed earlier) and manually walk through your code, line
            by line, demonstrating how the input is transformed into the correct
            output.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          A key interview pitfall:{" "}
          <strong>
            Don’t use overly large or complex test cases for your demo.
          </strong>{" "}
          You simply won’t have time to walk through every detail, and you risk
          confusing both yourself and your interviewer. Stick to small,
          digestible scenarios that clearly show your algorithm in action.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts: Your Roadmap to a Google Offer</h2>
        <p>
          If you methodically apply this three-stage framework—planning with
          clarity, coding with transparency, and explaining with confidence—you
          dramatically increase your chance of joining that elusive 1% who get
          the Google offer. It’s not just about brute-forcing practice problems.
          It’s about demonstrating mastery of your own thought process, flawless
          communication, and the ability to solve problems collaboratively.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remember: Before you type a single line of code, show you understand
          the problem. Walk the interviewer through your thinking, invite
          clarifications, and never be afraid to start simple before refining
          your solution. Communicate every step—not just in your code but in
          your voice. And when you’re finished, prove your answer with a clear,
          simple dry run.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the end, that’s what turns interviewers’ heads and earns you a seat
          at Google. Happy coding—and may your next interview be your last!
