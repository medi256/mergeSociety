      "This article provides insider advice from former Google engineer Anthony D. Mays about effective preparation for technical coding interviews. It criticizes the common approach of memorizing LeetCode solutions, instead advocating for understanding algorithmic patterns, developing problem-solving processes, and prioritizing communication skills. The article emphasizes that interviews are more about demonstrating thought processes than getting the perfect answer immediately, and offers practical advice on asking good questions, planning before coding, and collaborating with interviewers.",

          <strong>Sup nerds?</strong> If your coding interview prep involves
          endlessly grinding LeetCode questions and collecting “easy” badge
          streaks like Pokémon cards, hold up. <strong>Anthony D. Mays</strong>{" "}
          here—everyone’s favorite tech diversity hire, reporting for roll call
          and ready to keep it real with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, we’re breaking down the infamous LeetCode-style interviews you
          love to hate. And yes, you’re probably doing them all wrong. Harsh?
          Maybe. Needed? Absolutely. Over 32,000 readers vibed with my original
          2022 article, and 2,000 of them even smashed the like button.
          Apparently, people are desperate for honest advice about tech
          interviews (and maybe overdue for a dose of tough love).
        </p>
        <p>
          Below, I’ll walk you through what most people get wrong in their
          coding interview prep and the “why” behind my advice. I’ll give you
          the perspective straight from the interviewer’s side—yes, that’s me—so
          you can <strong>finally</strong> prepare for those top tech company
          interviews the right way.
        </p>
        <h2>Stop Memorizing LeetCode Questions</h2>
        <p>
          Let’s start with some real talk: I don’t trust you. Sorry, but it’s
          true! There’s a lot of money on the line for these tech jobs—think
          $300K, $400K, even $500K engineer salaries. I have to know you’re the
          real deal, not just a cunning LeetCode parrot or a wizard with a cheat
          sheet. That’s why, as interviewers, we don’t handpick problems
          straight off LeetCode and toss them to candidates. I mean, who knows
          what you might have memorized or what “unofficial aids” you might have
          lying around?
        </p>
        <p>
          If your prep strategy is to brute-force memorize every problem in the
          LeetCode vault—especially those dreaded hard problems—you’re missing
          the point entirely. It’s a complete waste of time to camp out in
          LeetCode Hell and speedrun to the first solution that comes to mind
          for each problem.
        </p>
        <h3>Patterns, Not Problems</h3>
        <p>
          Here’s where you’re messing up:{" "}
          <strong>
            Memorizing solutions doesn’t make you a good problem solver
          </strong>
          . The solution you memorized probably isn’t going to show up. Sure,
          you MIGHT stumble into something similar, but the odds aren’t in your
          favor. What’ll actually help you in interviews?{" "}
          <strong>Recognizing and applying patterns</strong>. Learn fundamental
          algorithms and coding patterns (like sliding window, recursion, divide
          and conquer)—because <em>those</em> are the tools you’ll reach for
          when faced with an unfamiliar challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hundreds of solved problems won’t mean much if you freeze the moment
          you see a new twist or don’t spot the underlying pattern. Practice
          recognizing, combining, and flexibly applying these patterns in new
          contexts. Trust me, that’s what interviewers want to see.
        </p>
        <h3>What’s Next: The Return of Whiteboard Interviews?</h3>
        <p>
          Some of y’all are going wild with AI, prompting suspicions and making
          things harder for everyone (your shenanigans might just bring back the
          dark age of in-person, computer-free, whiteboard interviews—yep, just
          like the “olden days”). It’s all fun and games until the keyboard gets
          taken away!
        </p>
        <h2>It’s Not Just About Being “Right”</h2>
        <p>
          Okay, you made it this far, so here’s the next truth bomb: I need more
          than just a correct answer. In fact, I might not even care if you
          nailed the final result on your first shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I really want is to <strong>pick your brain</strong>. I want to
          understand how you think, how you break down problems, and (most
          importantly) how you communicate when you get stuck. If you see a
          question and immediately know the answer because you memorized the
          problem, you’re not showing me your superpower—you’re hiding your
          process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think of it like a math test. If you just hand in the answer but don’t
          show the steps, how do I know you didn’t just copy? Same principle
          here: interviews are about <strong>process over product</strong>. I’d
          rather watch you wrestle with the unknown than regurgitate a slick,
          polished solution.
        </p>
        <h3>“Getting Stuck” Is Part of the Process</h3>
        <p>
          What happens if you hit a wall? Great! I WANT to see how you tackle
          the unknown. If I hand you a softball and you crush it, I’ll just
          throw a curveball or up the difficulty until I see what happens when
          you’re out of your comfort zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interviews are spaces for exploring—not for being perfect. If you fear
          getting stuck and avoid it at all costs, you’re not showing me what I
          need to know. Most people aren’t superhumans with instant recall for
          everything. Success is about adaptability and creative
          problem-solving, not just perfect memorization.
        </p>
        <h2>Interviews Aren’t Like LeetCode at Home</h2>
        <p>
          Here’s something candidates overlook: during real coding interviews,
          you’re NOT given the full, detailed problem description, all examples,
          and hints up front. This isn’t a take-home exam or a LeetCode sandbox.
          Often, you’ll only get the basic setup. It’s up to you to ask for
          further clarifications or test cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can’t tell you how many times people ask, “Are you going to paste
          the question in the chat?” Sorry champ, it’s your job to track what I
          say—ask for repetition if needed, but don’t expect handholding. Take
          notes. Gather requirements. Show initiative.
        </p>
        <h3>Asking Good Questions: Your Secret Weapon</h3>
        <p>
          Here’s your cheat code:{" "}
          <strong>Ask smart, targeted questions.</strong> As the interviewer, I
          want you to dig deeper, clarify the scope, and make sure you truly
          understand the task. And no, I’m not going to do the work for you.
          Your responsibility is to document what you hear and keep your own
          reference material clear—especially when the clock is ticking.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the way, there <strong>is</strong> such a thing as a dumb
          question—especially in a tight 45-minute (or one hour) interview. If I
          already gave you the answer and you weren’t listening, repeating your
          question just wastes everyone’s time. Listen carefully, and ask what
          really matters for you to move forward.
        </p>
        <h3>Don’t Start Coding Immediately: Plan First!</h3>
        <p>
          A telltale sign someone’s going to flop the interview? The moment they
          get the problem, they leap straight into coding. If you do this,
          you’re almost guaranteed to fail before you even type the first line.
          Why? Because you can’t solve what you don’t fully understand!
        </p>
        <p>
          Take the time to clarify, plan, and think through your approach.
          Gather all the requirements—don’t be shy about requesting
          clarifications or constraints. The interview is your opportunity to
          show how you collect and synthesize information under pressure.
        </p>
        <h2>How LeetCode and Similar Tools Actually Help</h2>
        <p>
          Wait—didn’t I just say LeetCode isn’t everything? True! But using
          platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank is still valuable: they expose
          you to diverse problem types and teach you how to ask the{" "}
          <em>right</em> questions. For example, by working through enough
          problems, you start developing intuition. You learn to inquire, “Is
          the input sorted?” or “Do I need to handle negative numbers?” (Because
          if your interviewer says the list is already sorted, you know that
          running a sorting algorithm is pointless—take that tool off your
          mental shelf!)
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, the questions you ask help you filter out which data
          structures and approaches are appropriate. By narrowing the field,
          you’ll make more informed decisions about which solution fits best.
          And if you can think of multiple approaches,{" "}
          <strong>ask for feedback.</strong> There’s nothing wrong with saying,
          “Would you prefer I try approach A or B?” Sometimes, I’ll nudge you
          toward the optimal path or save you time if one solution is more
          relevant to the conversation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And hey, sometimes I’ll want you to implement the naive
          (“brute-force”) solution before attempting optimizations. If you’re
          going to struggle with the straightforward approach, there’s no need
          to waste time trying the fancy one.
        </p>
        <h2>Final Thoughts: Communicate and Collaborate!</h2>
        <p>
          Remember, I’m not here as your enemy. Darth Vader to your Luke
          Skywalker? Maybe in your mind. But really, as your interviewer, my job
          is to <em>help</em> you, not try to trip you up! Success in the
          interview room is a conversation, not a monologue.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re not talking to me, asking smart questions, and brainstorming
          solutions aloud, I simply can’t help you. If you hit a wall, let me
          know. Invite me in to help you overcome obstacles—don’t go silent and
          hope for the best.
        </p>
        <p>
          Don’t just jump on the first solution that comes to mind. Take a beat.
          Consider multiple approaches. Discuss your plan and invite feedback at
          every step.
