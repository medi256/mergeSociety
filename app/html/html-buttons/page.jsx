      <h1>Buttons in HTML</h1>
      <p>
        Hello there! In this lesson, we'll be exploring buttons in HTML - one of
        the most commonly used interactive elements on web pages. Buttons allow
        users to trigger actions, submit forms, or navigate to different pages.
        Let's dive into the world of buttons in HTML and learn how to create
        them effectively.
      </p>

      <h2>What Are Buttons in HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        Buttons in HTML are interactive elements that users can click or tap to
        trigger an action. They are typically used for submitting forms,
        navigating to different pages, or performing specific tasks. Buttons are
        an essential part of user interfaces, providing a way for users to
        interact with your website or web application.
      </p>

      <h2>Creating Buttons in HTML</h2>
      <p>
        To create a button in HTML, you can use the <code>{`<button>`}</code>{" "}
        element. The
        <code>{`<button>`}</code> element represents a clickable button that
        users can interact with. {` Here's the basic structure of a button:`}
      </p>

      <code>
        <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
          {`
<button>Click me!</button>
        `}
        </SyntaxHighlighter>
      </code>

      <p>
        In the code above, <code>{`<button>`}</code> is the opening tag, and{" "}
        <code>{`</button>`}</code> is the closing tag. The text between the tags
        represents the label or text that users will see on the button.
      </p>

      <h2>Types of Buttons in HTML</h2>
      <p>There are different types of buttons you can create in HTML:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Submit Buttons:</strong> Submit buttons are used within forms
          to allow users to submit their data. They are typically used with the
          <code>{`<form>`}</code> element.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regular Buttons:</strong> Regular buttons are used for general
          purposes, such as navigating to a different page or performing a
          specific action.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples of Buttons in HTML</h2>
      <p>Here are some examples of creating buttons in HTML:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Submit Button:</strong>
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
                {`
<form>
  <input type="text" name="username">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
            
            `}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regular Button:</strong>
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
                {`
<button>Click me!</button>
            
            `}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Best Practices for Buttons in HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Use descriptive labels:</strong> Provide clear and descriptive
          labels for your buttons, so users know what action will be triggered
          when they click the button.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use appropriate button types:</strong> Use the "submit" type
          for buttons within forms, and the "button" type for regular buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ensure accessibility:</strong> Make sure your buttons are
          accessible to users with disabilities. Use the "aria-label" attribute
          to provide a descriptive label for screen readers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Test button functionality:</strong> Always test your buttons
          to ensure they work as intended across different browsers and devices.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Practice Time!</h2>
      <p>
        Now, let's put your knowledge into practice! Open your code editor and
        create a new HTML file. Experiment with creating different types of
        buttons and adding functionality. Here's a simple exercise to get you
        started:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Create a new HTML file and save it as "buttons.html" in your workspace
          folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a submit button within a form. For example,
          <br />
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
                {`
<form>
  <input type="text" name="username">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
            
              `}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Try creating a regular button with a descriptive label. For instance,
          <br />
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
                {`

<button>Click me to continue</button>.
`}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
