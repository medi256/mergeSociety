      <h1>Comments in HTML</h1>
      <p>
        Hello there! In this lesson, we'll be exploring comments in HTML - a
        feature that allows you to include notes, explanations, or instructions
        in your HTML code. Comments are ignored by web browsers, meaning they
        won't be displayed on the web page itself. Comments are useful for
        providing additional information, documenting your code, or temporarily
        disabling certain parts of your code during development or testing.
        Let's dive into the world of comments in HTML and learn how to use them
        effectively.
      </p>

      <h2>What Are Comments in HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        Comments in HTML are special constructs that allow you to include notes,
        explanations, or instructions within your HTML code. Comments are
        denoted by specific delimiters, and they are not rendered or displayed
        on the web page. Comments are primarily intended for providing
        information or instructions to other developers who may work on the
        code.
      </p>

      <h2>Creating Comments in HTML</h2>
      <p>
        Comments in HTML are created using special delimiters that indicate the
        beginning and end of the comment. Here's the basic structure of an HTML
        comment:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
            {`
<!-- This is a comment -->
        `}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the code above, the <code>{`<!--`}</code> marks the start of the
        comment, and the <code>{`-->`}</code>
        marks the end of the comment. Anything within these delimiters is
        considered a comment and will be ignored by web browsers.
      </p>

      <h2>Using Comments in HTML</h2>
      <p>Comments in HTML can be used for various purposes:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Documentation:</strong> Comments can be used to provide
          explanations, instructions, or additional information about your code.
          This helps other developers understand your code and its
          functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Temporary Disabling:</strong> Comments can be used to
          temporarily disable certain parts of your HTML code during development
          or testing. This allows you to test different scenarios or disable
          specific features without deleting the code entirely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Comments can be used to communicate
          with other developers working on the same project. You can leave
          notes, ask questions, or provide feedback within the HTML code itself.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples of Comments in HTML</h2>
      <p>Here are some examples of using comments in HTML:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Documentation Comment:</strong>
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
                {`
<!-- This section displays the user's profile information -->
<div class="user-profile">
  <h2>User Profile</h2>
  <p>Name: <span class="name">John Doe</span></p>
  <p>Email: <span class="email">john@example.com</span></p>
</div>
          
          `}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Temporary Disabling Comment:</strong>
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
                {`
<!-- This feature is temporarily disabled -->
<div>
  <!-- <p>This section is hidden</p> -->
</div>
            
            `}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Collaboration Comment:</strong>
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
                {`
<!-- Note to other developers: This section requires additional testing and validation -->
            
            `}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <AdUnit />
      <h2>Best Practices for Comments in HTML</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Use comments for documentation:</strong> Include comments to
          provide explanations, instructions, or additional information about
          your HTML code. This helps other developers understand and collaborate
          more effectively.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keep comments concise and relevant:</strong> Avoid writing
          lengthy comments that may become outdated or confusing. Keep your
          comments focused on providing valuable information.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Update and remove outdated comments:</strong> Ensure that your
          comments remain accurate and relevant. Remove comments that are no
          longer applicable to avoid confusion for other developers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Practice Time!</h2>
      <p>
        Now, let's put your knowledge into practice! Open your code editor and
        create a new HTML file. Experiment with adding comments, documenting
        your HTML code, or temporarily disabling certain parts. Here's a simple
        exercise to get you started:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Create a new HTML file and save it as "comments.html" in your
          workspace folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a comment to provide an explanation for a section of your HTML
          code. For example,
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
                {`
<!-- This section displays the navigation menu -->.
              `}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Try using comments to temporarily disable certain parts of your HTML
          code during development or testing. For instance,
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
                {`
<!-- This feature is under development and will be enabled soon -->.
              
              `}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <AdUnit />
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In this lesson, we've explored comments in HTML, including their
        purpose, usage, and best practices. Comments are a valuable tool for
        providing additional information, documenting your code, or temporarily
        disabling certain parts. Remember to use comments wisely, keep them
        concise and relevant, and always consider the audience who may read and
        benefit from your comments. In the next lesson, we'll continue our
        journey by exploring the Structure of an HTML Document. Stay tuned, and
        happy coding!
