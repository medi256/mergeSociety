        <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to the exciting world of HTML! In this course, you will learn
          about the fundamentals of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the
          backbone of every website you visit on the internet. HTML is a simple
          yet powerful language that allows us to create structured and
          interactive web pages. Let's dive in and explore its history, purpose,
          and how it works alongside other technologies like{" "}
          <Link href={"/css"} passHref>
            CSS
          </Link>{" "}
          and{" "}
          <Link href={"/javascript"} passHref>
            JavaScript
          </Link>{" "}
          to bring websites to life!
        </p>

        <h2>A Brief History of HTML</h2>
        <p>
          HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in the late 1980s while he was
          working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research. The
          goal was to create a system for sharing and distributing information
          among researchers easily. HTML became the standard markup language for
          creating web pages and has evolved over the years with various
          versions, such as HTML+, HTML 2.0, and the current HTML5.
        </p>

        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>
          HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web
          applications. It uses a set of tags and attributes to define the
          structure and content of a web page. HTML tells the web browser what
          to display and how to interpret the content, such as headings,
          paragraphs, images, videos, and links.
        </p>

        <h2>How HTML Works with CSS and JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
          HTML is often used alongside two other essential web technologies:{" "}
          <Link href={"/css"} passHref>
            CSS
          </Link>
          (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript. CSS is responsible for the
          styling and layout of the HTML content, making it visually appealing.
          <Link href={"/javascript"} passHref>
            JavaScript
          </Link>
          , on the other hand, adds interactivity to the web page, enabling
          dynamic behavior and responsive user interfaces. Together, HTML, CSS,
          and JavaScript form the foundation of modern web development.
        </p>

        <h2>The Power of HTML: What Can It Do?</h2>
        <p>
          HTML is everywhere on the web! It helps us display text, images,
          videos, forms, tables, and much more. With HTML, you can create
          informative web pages, build interactive forms for user input, embed
          multimedia content, and structure your website's content logically.
          Companies and organizations of all sizes rely on HTML to build their
          websites, from small startups to large enterprises like Google,
          Facebook, and Amazon.
        </p>

        <h2>Your HTML Workspace: Setting Up Your Environment</h2>
        <h3>For PC Users</h3>
        <p>
          To start your HTML journey, you'll need a code editor - a special
          program designed for writing and editing code. There are many code
          editors available, but for this course, we recommend using Visual
          Studio Code (also known as VSCode). It's a free, powerful, and
          user-friendly editor that will make your coding experience enjoyable.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Download VSCode:</strong> Head over to the VSCode website
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">
              (visit to download)
            </a>{" "}
            and download the installer for your operating system. Install VSCode
            on your computer by following the installation wizard.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create a New Folder:</strong> Open Windows Explorer or
            Finder (on Mac) and create a new folder for your HTML projects. You
            can name it anything you like, or simply leave it as it is.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Open VSCode:</strong> Launch VSCode and drag and drop your
            new folder into the VSCode window. This will set the folder as your
            workspace.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create Your First HTML File:</strong> In VSCode, navigate to
            the "Explorer" tab on the left sidebar. Click on the "New File" icon
            (or press Ctrl+N on Windows or Cmd+N on Mac) to create a new file.
            Name it "index.html" (the ".html" extension is important!). Save the
            file by pressing Ctrl+S (Windows) or Cmd+S (Mac) or clicking the
            "Save" icon.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>View Your HTML in the Browser:</strong> Now, let's write
            some basic HTML code! Copy and paste the following code into your
            "index.html" file:
            <pre>
              <code>
                <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
                  {`
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML code!</p>
  </body>
</html>
        
        `}
                </SyntaxHighlighter>
              </code>
            </pre>
            Save the file again. To view your handiwork, open the folder you
            created in your file explorer, find the "index.html" file, and drag
            and drop it into your web browser. Congratulations! You've just
            created and viewed your first website! Don't worry about memorizing
            the code; we'll break down each part in the upcoming lessons.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>For Mobile Users</h3>
        <p>
          If you're using a mobile device, there are several code editors
          available on iOS and Android that you can use. We recommend editors
          with built-in browsers for convenience. Here are the steps to get
          started:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Download a Mobile Code Editor:</strong> Search for "code
            editor" on your device's app store and download one with good
            reviews and a built-in browser (e.g., "Dcoder," "Code Editor," or
            "Coding Studio").
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Create a New File:</strong> Open the app and create a new
            file. Name it "index.html" and make sure to save it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Write Your First HTML Code:</strong>
            Copy and paste the same HTML code provided earlier into your
            "index.html" file. Save your changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>View Your HTML in the Browser:</strong>
            Most mobile code editors will have a "Run" or "Preview" button. Tap
            that button to view your HTML code in the built-in browser. If your
            editor doesn't have a built-in browser, you may need to copy the
            file to a cloud storage service (like Dropbox) and open it from
            there in a mobile browser.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Understanding the ".html" Extension</h2>
        <p>
          You might be wondering why we use the ".html" extension for our HTML
          files. This extension is essential because it tells the web browser
          that the file contains HTML code and should be interpreted as such.
          Other programming and markup languages have their own extensions, like
          ".css" for CSS files and ".js" for JavaScript files. This helps both
          humans and computers quickly identify the type of content in a file.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remember, this is just an introduction to what your appetite! In the
          upcoming lessons, we'll dive deeper into each aspect of HTML,
          exploring tags, attributes, and more. So, get ready to embark on an
          exciting journey as we unlock the secrets of HTML together!
