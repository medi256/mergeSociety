      <p>
        Hello there! In this lesson, we'll be exploring divs - one of the most
        fundamental building blocks of HTML. Divs, short for divisions, are
        versatile containers that are used to group and structure HTML elements.
        Divs allow you to organize your content, apply styles, and create
        layouts. Let's dive into the world of divs in HTML and learn how to use
        them effectively.
      </p>

      <h2>What Are Divs in HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        Divs, represented by the <code>{`<div>`}</code> tag, are block-level
        elements that act as containers for other HTML elements. They don't have
        any specific visual appearance on their own, but they are used to group
        and organize content. Divs are commonly used to create sections,
        columns, or separate different parts of a web page. Here's the basic
        structure of a div in HTML:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
            {`
<div>
Content goes here 
</div>
`}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the code above, the <code>{`<div>`}</code> tag defines the beginning
        of the div, and the closing <code>{`</div>`}</code> tag marks the end of
        the div. You can place other HTML elements or content within the div to
        group them together.
      </p>

      <h2>Using Divs for Structure and Layout</h2>
      <p>
        Divs are commonly used to create the overall structure and layout of a
        web page. They can be nested inside each other to create hierarchical
        relationships and define sections of the page. Here's an example:
      </p>

      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
            {`
<div>
<div>Header</div>
<div>
<div>Sidebar</div>
<div>Main Content</div>
</div>
<div>Footer</div>
</div>

`}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the code above, we have a nested structure of divs. The outer div
        represents the entire web page, while the inner divs represent different
        sections of the page, such as the header, sidebar, main content, and
        footer.
      </p>

      <h2>Applying Styles to Divs</h2>
      <p>
        You can apply styles to divs using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). By
        assigning a class or id attribute to a div, you can target it with CSS
        rules and customize its appearance. Here's an example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
            {`
<div class="container">
<div class="header">Header</div>
<div class="content">Main Content</div>
<div class="sidebar">Sidebar</div>
</div>

`}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>
        In the code above, we added class attributes to each div, such as
        "container," "header," and "sidebar." You can then use CSS to style
        these divs and control their appearance, such as background color,
        width, height, padding, and more.
      </p>

      <h2>Best Practices for Using Divs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Use divs for structure and layout:</strong> Divs are ideal for
          creating the overall structure and layout of your web page. Use them
          to group related elements and create sections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nest divs for hierarchy:</strong> Divs can be nested inside
          each other to create hierarchical relationships and define the flow of
          your content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use meaningful class and id attributes:</strong> Assign
          descriptive class and id attributes to your divs, making it easier to
          target them with CSS or JavaScript.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Avoid using divs for styling only:</strong> Divs should be
          used primarily for structure and organization, not just for styling
          purposes. Use CSS to apply styles to your divs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Keep divs semantic:</strong> Use divs to create meaningful
          sections or groups of content. Avoid using divs just for visual
          styling without any structural purpose.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Practice Time!</h2>
      <p>
        Now, let's put your knowledge into practice! Open your code editor and
        create a new HTML file. Experiment with creating divs, nesting them, and
        applying styles using CSS. Here's a simple exercise to get you started:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Create a new HTML file and save it as "divs.html" in your workspace
          folder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a basic structure for a web page using divs, such as a header,
          main content area, and footer. For example,
          <br />
          <pre>
            <code>
              <SyntaxHighlighter language="HTML" style={docco}>
                {`
<div>
<div>Header</div>
<div>Main Content</div>
<div>Footer</div>
</div>

`}
              </SyntaxHighlighter>
            </code>
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Try nesting divs within each other to create more complex structures.
          For instance, you can have a div for the main content area, and within
          that, you can have divs for different sections or columns.
        </li>
        <li>
          Apply styles to your divs using CSS. For example, you can use CSS to
          change the background color, add borders, or adjust the width and
          height of the divs.
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In this lesson, we've explored divs in HTML, including their purpose,
        how to use them for structure and layout, applying styles, and best
        practices. Divs are fundamental building blocks of HTML and play a
        crucial role in creating modern web pages. Remember to use divs wisely,
        follow best practices, and always test your HTML and CSS code to ensure
        your divs render correctly in different browsers and devices. In the
        next lesson, we'll move on to span in HTML. Stay tuned, and happy
        coding!
