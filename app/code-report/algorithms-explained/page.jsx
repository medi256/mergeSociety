        <p>
          <strong>
            By David J. Malan, Harvard University Professor of Computer Science
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          In today's technological landscape, the word <em>algorithm</em> is
          everywhere: powering search engines, customizing your social media
          feed, and even lurking in the background as you unlock your phone. But
          what really is an algorithm? How does it shape the modern (and even
          not so modern) world? Join Harvard Professor David J. Malan as he
          tackles the concept of algorithms in five levels of escalating
          complexity, illuminating how these powerful sets of instructions
          underpin everything from making a peanut butter sandwich to training
          the world’s most advanced artificial intelligences.
        </p>

        <h2>Level 1: Algorithms for Everyday Life</h2>
        <p>
          To begin, let's step away from the digital world and think in more
          familiar terms. As Professor Malan introduces himself, he highlights
          an encouraging idea: algorithms are everywhere not just inside
          computers and smartphones, but in daily routines we often overlook.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine preparing for bedtime. There’s a sequence, right? Get dressed,
          brush your teeth, read a story, then sleep. That, in its essence,{" "}
          <strong>is an algorithm</strong>: a precise list of instructions to
          solve a specific problem in this case, transitioning from “awake and
          energetic” to “peacefully asleep.”
        </p>

        <h3>Making a Sandwich A Real World Algorithm in Action</h3>
        <p>
          To illustrate how specifying steps matters, Professor Malan and a
          young helper play a game: “Pretend I’m a robot, and you program me to
          make a peanut butter sandwich.”
        </p>
        <p>Their instructions go something like this:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the bag of bread.</li>
          <li>Grab the bread and put it on the plate.</li>
          <li>
            Take all the bread back and put it back in there. (Oops! An undo
            command, like Ctrl+Z.)
          </li>
          <li>Take one bread and put it on the plate.</li>
          <li>Take the lid off the peanut butter jar, put the lid down.</li>
          <li>
            Take a knife, dip it in the peanut butter, and spread it on the
            bread.
          </li>
          <li>Place another slice of bread on top, flat.</li>
          <li>Take a delicious bite!</li>
          <li>
            Finally, clean up the mess. (Because even robots should be tidy.)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Through this playful exercise, Malan demonstrates why{" "}
          <strong>precision and clarity in algorithms are crucial</strong>. Miss
          a step, or phrase it ambiguously, and things might go (hilariously)
          wrong such as accidentally pulling out all the bread instead of just
          one slice. The very same principle is what guides computers, which
          require step by step, unambiguous, and often painfully specific
          instructions to function properly.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, shift your attention to a scenario familiar to both past and
          present generations: searching for a contact. Why does your phone
          organize contacts alphabetically? Because searching through an
          unorganized list is an <strong>inefficient algorithm</strong>: you’d
          have to scroll all the way to the bottom even if your friend John’s
          name is there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Professor Malan recalls the phonebook era a time when every household
          had a thick directory of names and numbers, alphabetized for
          efficiency. Suppose you’re searching for “John.” There are several
          strategies (algorithms):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Linear Search</strong>: Start at the beginning and scan one
            by one. For a thousand page phone book, you might have to check
            every page quite slow!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Skip/Step Search</strong>: Check every two pages instead of
            one. It’s twice as fast but there's a 50/50 chance of skipping over
            your target!
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Divide and Conquer (Binary Search)</strong>: Open the phone
            book to the middle. If you’re in the “K” section and want “John,”
            you know to search to the left. Split the book in half again, check
            the middle of that half, and so on. Each time, you’re cutting the
            problem size in half. For a thousand page book, this takes about 10
            steps instead of a thousand a <strong>dramatic speedup</strong>{" "}
            powering modern search algorithms.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These search strategies are more than just theory: your smartphone
          (and Google itself) use advanced versions of “divide and conquer”
          every time you search for a name, a website, or your favorite song.
          This ability to{" "}
          <strong>
            systematically break down a problem into smaller parts
          </strong>{" "}
          is at the heart of algorithmic thinking and efficiency.
        </p>

        <h2>Level 3: Sorting the Chaos – Bubble Sort and Beyond</h2>
        <p>
          How do we turn a jumble of numbers or names into an ordered, easily
          searchable list? Patricia, a senior at NYU, remembers learning about{" "}
          <strong>bubble sort</strong> in her first computer science classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s how it works, step by step, using magnets on a chalkboard to
          represent numbers:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Start with a row of unsorted numbers (e.g. 8, 1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 7, 5).
          </li>
          <li>
            Compare the first two numbers. If they’re in the wrong order (e.g.
            8, 1), swap them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Move to the next pair (now 8, 2). Keep swapping any out of order
            pairs, one by one, until you reach the end of the list.
          </li>
          <li>The largest number has "bubbled" to the end.</li>
          <li>
            Ignore the last item (since it’s now sorted), and repeat the process
            for the rest over and over, shrinking the unsorted portion each
            time.{" "}
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Gradually, everything falls into place from smallest to largest. This
          is simple but not always fast compared to more advanced sorting
          algorithms. Still, it’s a perfect demonstration of fixing “local”
          small problems to organize the bigger picture.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the world’s biggest companies like Google or Bing don’t use
          bubble sort on the entire internet (the scale would be impossible!),
          they{" "}
          <strong>
            rely on underlying algorithms to organize and retrieve information
            efficiently
          </strong>
          just as we do in our daily routines.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Level 4: Algorithms Behind Social Media Feeds and AI Recommendations
        </h2>
        <p>
          Think about your <strong>For You</strong> page on TikTok, or the next
          show that pops up on Netflix these aren't random suggestions. They’re
          the result of highly sophisticated algorithms, often powered by{" "}
          <strong>machine learning</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          These algorithms take into account every video you watch, each post
          you like, and even what your friends are engaging with. They don’t
          just follow if/then statements written by human coders. No one at
          TikTok is typing explicit instructions like, “If Patricia likes post
          X, show her post Y.” Instead, advanced models digest immense amounts
          of data, spot patterns, and make recommendations to keep users engaged
          (and platforms profitable).
        </p>
        <p>
          These are <strong>learning algorithms</strong> capable of adjusting
          and getting better over time as they’re exposed to more data.
          Techniques like <strong>neural networks</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>reinforcement learning</strong> allow these systems to “learn”
          what you want without needing explicit instructions for every possible
          user action.
        </p>

        <h3>Algorithms in Research and Industry</h3>
        <p>
          The reach of algorithms doesn't stop at entertainment and search. As
          an NYU PhD student specializing in robot learning describes,
          innovations in algorithms are driven by <em>inefficiency</em>: "How
          could this process be made faster, smarter, more effective?” In
          robotics and AI, old school rule based systems (e.g., A* search for
          games) work well in limited domains. But as systems become more
          complex, learning algorithms those that adapt and optimize based on
          growing datasets now dominate, from board games like Go to routing
          trains across entire cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Modern society is awash in algorithms: from transit routes to
          financial data, online advertising to logistics. But while this brings
          enormous efficiency and customization, it also means trade offs:{" "}
          <strong>increased data mining</strong>, new privacy concerns, and the
          subtle shaping of our online experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          As algorithms become more pervasive and more advanced even experts
          note the line between “good” and “bad” consequences isn’t always
          clear. Ultimately, it’s about balance: using algorithms to make life
          better, while understanding their limitations and impact.
        </p>

        <h2>Level 5: The Mystery and Future of AI Algorithms</h2>
        <p>
          According to Chris Wiggins, Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics
          at Columbia and Chief Data Scientist at The New York Times, data
          science teams are responsible for crafting and integrating algorithms
          that quietly power everything from personalized recommendations to
          workflow efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          In modern data science, an <strong>algorithm</strong> might mean an
          optimization method for building the best statistical model or even a
          complete “data product” integrated into business platforms or
          newsrooms. But as machine learning (ML) and AI explode in popularity,
          the field is rapidly evolving:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Generative AI</strong> (like ChatGPT and other large
            language models) can perform incredible tricks, yet sometimes even
            their creators can’t fully explain how they work or why they produce
            certain results.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lack of Transparency</strong>: As models become larger and
            more complex billions of parameters strong even the programmers and
            data scientists struggle to understand their inner workings. This
            opacity is both inevitable (given the sheer scale) and a little
            unnerving.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Does It Matter?</strong> For most users, it seldom matters
            precisely <em>how</em> ChatGPT sorts your list or recommends the
            next article much as drivers use a car without understanding
            internal combustion. However, fundamental understanding still fuels
            innovation: when old “proofs” are debunked or new optimizations
            discovered, the entire field moves forward.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With the recent advances and splashy successes of AI from chatbots to
          deepfakes the world is confronting both new potential and new risks.
          Should you steer away from a career in computer science just because
          of these breakthroughs? Absolutely not! The fundamentals of algorithms
          remain central: training, fine tuning, and optimizing these models are
          themselves algorithmic challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI technology is neither inherently good nor bad, as{" "}
          <strong>Kranzberg’s First Law of Technology</strong> reminds us:
          “Technology is neither good nor bad, nor is it neutral.” How we
          develop, understand, and use these tools will shape the world to come.
        </p>

        <h2>From Bedtime Routines to Complex AI: The Algorithmic Journey</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you're teaching a child to make a sandwich, searching for a
          friend in a contacts list, building game winning strategies, or
          deploying the latest neural networks,{" "}
          <strong>algorithms underpin it all</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those just beginning their own journey, the endgame those dazzling
          feats of AI might feel far away. But with each concept learned and
          every small algorithm mastered, that world draws closer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next time you swipe, search, or ask an AI for help, remember:
          there are layers of ingenious algorithms making it all possible. And
          each step forward is a testament to the creativity and precision of
          the human mind.
