          text: "React hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. In 2025, hooks are the standard approach for React development as they offer several advantages: 1) They eliminate the complexity of class components and lifecycle methods, 2) They make it easier to reuse stateful logic between components through custom hooks, 3) They encourage component composition over inheritance, 4) They work seamlessly with React's concurrent rendering features, and 5) They enable more predictable and testable code. With React 19, hooks have become even more powerful with additions that improve performance and developer experience. Class components, while still supported, are considered legacy code in modern React applications.",

          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "Use useMemo when you need to memoize expensive computed values to prevent unnecessary recalculations during re-renders. Examples include complex data transformations, filtering large arrays, or heavy mathematical calculations. Use useCallback when you need to memoize function definitions, particularly when those functions are passed as props to optimized child components using React.memo, or when the function is a dependency in another hook's dependency array. The key difference: useMemo returns a memoized value, while useCallback returns a memoized function. In 2025's React, the performance differences are subtle but important for complex applications—React 19's compiler optimizations have reduced the need for manual memoization in simpler cases, but these hooks remain crucial for optimizing computationally expensive operations and preventing unnecessary re-renders in component trees.",

        acceptedAnswer: {
          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "The rules of React hooks are: 1) Only call hooks at the top level of your function component or custom hook—never inside loops, conditions, or nested functions, and 2) Only call hooks from React function components or custom hooks—not regular JavaScript functions. These rules matter because hooks rely on a stable call order between renders to correctly associate state with the component instance. Breaking these rules can cause bugs where state becomes unpredictable, effects run incorrectly, or components behave inconsistently. In 2025, React's tooling now provides better guardrails: the ESLint plugin for hooks has improved detection capabilities, and React 19's new compiler can identify and warn about potential rules violations during build time. While the Core team has researched ways to remove these constraints, they remain fundamental to how hooks work under the hood.",

          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "React 19 introduced several new hooks that enhance performance and developer experience: 1) useEvent creates stable event handlers that access the latest props/state without re-renders or dependency arrays, perfect for event callbacks. 2) useFormStatus provides form submission state for creating responsive UIs during form actions. 3) useOptimistic implements optimistic UI updates for better perceived performance during async operations. 4) useFormState manages form state with built-in validation and submission handling. 5) useActionState tracks the status of actions initiated by components. To use these hooks, ensure you're on React 19+ and import them from the React package. Unlike previous experimental hooks, these are fully stable and production-ready. Each hook addresses specific pain points in React development, particularly around form handling, server interactions, and performance optimization in complex interactive applications.",

          "@type": "Answer",
          text: "To create a custom hook in React: 1) Create a function starting with 'use' (e.g., useWindowSize). 2) Use existing React hooks inside your custom hook. 3) Return any values your components need. For example, a simple custom hook for window dimensions would look like: 'function useWindowSize() { const [size, setSize] = useState({width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight}); useEffect(() => { const handleResize = () => setSize({width: window.innerWidth, height: window.innerHeight}); window.addEventListener(\"resize\", handleResize); return () => window.removeEventListener(\"resize\", handleResize); }, []); return size; }'. To use it, simply import and call it in your component: 'const { width, height } = useWindowSize();'. Custom hooks excel at extracting repetitive logic like API calls, form handling, animations, or device interactions. They follow the same rules as built-in hooks and can compose other custom hooks, enabling a powerful pattern of composition rather than inheritance for sharing stateful logic between components.",

        </h2>
        <p>
          So, you’ve decided to build a React app. Fantastic! That likely means
          you’ll spend some quality time with React hooks—the powerful functions
          that let you manage state, side effects, refs, context, and more
          within your components. The only catch: React has quite a bouquet of
          hooks, and it’s not always obvious which one to reach for in a given
          situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s embark on a guided tour through every major React hook. We’ll
          explore exactly what each hook does, outline the best ways to use
          them, and break down how often you’ll find them useful—from the go-to,
          daily-use hooks to the rare gems you might only need for advanced
          scenarios. To make this grand tour easier, I’ve built a mental “map”
          of React hooks, grouping them into eight major categories. You’ll see
          how each fits into the bigger picture as you build scalable,
          maintainable React apps.
        </p>
        <h2>
          State Management Hooks: useState, useReducer, and useSyncExternalStore
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>useState</strong> is the bread and butter of any React
          developer. If you’re not using a larger framework for state
          management, you’ll use <code>useState</code> a lot. In fact, the very
          reason React exists is to help us manage state and re-render
          components as that state changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>useState</code> shines in client components with their own
          simple, component-specific state. Its versatility is unmatched:
          capture user input in form fields, show or hide modals, tooltips, or
          dropdowns with booleans, conditionally add CSS classes, or keep track
          of numbers for things like shopping carts or counters.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use <code>useState</code>, you provide an initial value (really,
          any JavaScript value)—that value lands in a state variable, which
          React keeps track of. You’ll receive an array with two items: the
          state value and a function to update it. In code, you typically
          destructure them like so:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>{`const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Whenever you call the updater function, React re-renders the component
          with the new state.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>useReducer</strong> is another state hook, but you’ll reach
          for it less often. It works wonders for more complex, interrelated
          state—think forms with lots of inputs, or game states where several
          values change together. <code>useReducer</code> takes a reducer
          function (which receives state and an action, then returns new state)
          and an initial value. It returns the current state and a{" "}
          <code>dispatch</code> function to trigger updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          This centralizes all state updates in a single function, making your
          codebase much easier to maintain as your apps scale. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="jsx" style={docco}>
              {`
  const initialState = { count: 0 };
  function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
      case 'increment': return { count: state.count + 1 };
      default: return state;
    }
  }
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          <strong>useSyncExternalStore</strong>, on the other hand, is—let’s be
          honest—pretty niche. You probably won’t use it unless you’re writing
          your own state management solution from scratch, or need to sync
          non-React data stores into React’s ecosystem. Most developers can
          safely skip this one.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Effect Hooks: useEffect, useLayoutEffect, and useInsertionEffect
        </h2>
        <p>
          Time to talk side effects! “Side effects” are any interactions with
          systems outside of React—like updating the browser title, fetching
          data, or synchronizing with browser APIs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>useEffect</strong> is the familiar workhorse here. You give it
          a function to run, and by default, React runs it after every render.
          You can limit when it runs by supplying a dependencies array. When a
          value in that array changes, the effect runs again. For example,
          changing the browser tab’s title when a button is clicked:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="jsx" style={docco}>
              {`
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = \`Count: \${count}\`;
  }, [count]);
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>There are two broad types of side effects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Event-based side effects</strong>: things that happen in
            response to a user event, like a button press.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Render-based side effects</strong>: things that run after a
            component renders, like fetching data from an API.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          But here’s a power tip: in modern React, don’t use{" "}
          <code>useEffect</code> for everything! For event-based effects, put
          the logic straight in your event handler. For data fetching, libraries
          like React Query or your framework’s own tools (such as Next.js data
          fetching methods) are often superior.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when <em>should</em> you use <code>useEffect</code>? Primarily to
          synchronize React with browser APIs or other external systems. For
          example, synchronizing component state with the browser’s media API to
          play or pause a video.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>useLayoutEffect</strong> is a special variant that runs{" "}
          <em>before</em> React paints the UI, synchronously. It’s useful when
          you need to measure or update the DOM before the user sees any
          changes—such as measuring the height of a tooltip and setting it in
          state before it appears onscreen. (This technique ensures the layout
          is accurate on first visual paint!)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>useInsertionEffect</strong> is even more niche, usually
          relevant only to library authors creating CSS-in-JS libraries like
          Styled Components or Framer Motion. This hook runs before{" "}
          <code>useEffect</code> and <code>useLayoutEffect</code>, allowing the
          insertion of styles just in time for them to be read by other effect
          hooks.
        </p>
        <h2>Ref Hooks: useRef and useImperativeHandle</h2>
        <p>
          Refs let you hang on to a value across renders without triggering
          re-renders if that value changes. <strong>useRef</strong> is a bit
          like <code>useState</code>, but for non-display data. It returns a
          single object with a <code>current</code> property:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>{`const timerRef = useRef(null);`}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          You can set <code>timerRef.current</code> directly, making this
          perfect for non-stateful data like interval IDs, or referencing DOM
          elements. Here’s how you might store an interval ID for a timer, so
          you can clear it in a <code>stopTimer</code> function.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>useRef</strong> also shines for DOM access—just connect the
          returned ref to the <code>ref</code> prop of any React element, and
          then use <code>ref.current</code> to directly access the underlying
          DOM node.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>useImperativeHandle</strong>, meanwhile, is quite rare. It’s
          used when a parent needs to call a function (like <code>focus()</code>
          ) on a child component via refs. To do this, you combine{" "}
          <code>forwardRef</code> with <code>useImperativeHandle</code>—a
          pattern that lets you expose only specific functions (not the whole
          instance) to the parent. Note: in React 19, this whole (slightly
          clunky) dance gets much simpler.
        </p>
        <h2>Performance Hooks: useMemo and useCallback</h2>
        <p>
          When it comes to optimizing React applications, two hooks deserve
          special mention: <strong>useMemo</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>useCallback</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>useMemo</code> helps you avoid expensive recalculations by{" "}
          <em>memoizing</em> the result of a function—only recomputing it when
          its dependencies change. Think: running an intensive calculation (like
          summing a large array) only when absolutely necessary.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>{`const sum = useMemo(() => numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0), [numbers]);`}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          <code>useMemo</code> looks similar to <code>useEffect</code>, but{" "}
          <strong>it always returns a value</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>never produces side effects</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>useCallback</code> is closely related. Instead of memoizing a
          value, it memoizes a function. This is especially important for
          callback functions passed to deeply nested child components. Without
          it, a new function gets created on every render—sometimes triggering
          unnecessary renders in optimized child components.
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>{`const increment = useCallback(() => setCount(c => c + 1), []);`}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          Pass <code>increment</code> to your <code>&lt;Button /&gt;</code>{" "}
          components with confidence—React won’t re-create the function unless
          its dependencies change.
        </p>
        <h2>Context Hook: useContext</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>useContext</strong> lets you read values from a React Context.
          It’s incredibly simple: as long as your component is rendered inside a
          Provider (no matter how many components deep), you can call{" "}
          <code>useContext</code> to access the context’s value:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>{`const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);`}</code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          That’s it! It’s a clean and powerful way to share data down the tree
          without prop drilling.
        </p>
        <h2>Transition Hooks: useTransition and useDeferredValue</h2>
        <p>
          Traditionally, any state update in React is treated as
          urgent—everything re-renders immediately. But what if you’re running a
          really heavy computation or updating a giant list? That can make your
          UI feel sluggish or unresponsive.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>useTransition</strong> offers a way to mark certain state
          updates as “not urgent.” You wrap these updates in a{" "}
          <code>startTransition</code> callback. React knows it can defer this
          work until a less busy moment—keeping your app snappy. It also
          provides an <code>isPending</code> boolean so you can show loading
          indicators while transitions are happening. For example, filtering a
          list as users type, without making every keystroke slow things down:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="jsx" style={docco}>
              {`
  const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition();
  
  function handleInputChange(e) {
    startTransition(() => {
      setFilter(e.target.value);
    });
  }
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          <strong>useDeferredValue</strong> works similarly, but with a slightly
          different approach. Instead of wrapping a callback, you pass the{" "}
          <em>value</em> you want to defer directly to the hook. React schedules
          the update at the optimal time for performance. This is handy for
          things like list filtering as well, and—bonus—you don’t have to manage
          any pending state yourself!
        </p>
        <h2>Miscellaneous Hooks: useDebugValue and useId</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>useDebugValue</strong> is mainly for library and advanced
          custom hook authors, especially if you use React DevTools. By labeling
          your hooks with a string, you make debugging easier and faster when
          tracking down custom hook usage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>useId</strong> does exactly what the name implies: generates a
          unique ID for each call. A common use case is giving form inputs and
          their labels matching, unique IDs—especially important when those
          components might appear multiple times on one page. For instance, if
          you reuse an <code>&lt;EmailInput /&gt;</code> component twice in a
          form, <code>useId</code> ensures each has a collision-proof ID.
        </p>
        <p className="alert alert-warning">
          <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Don’t use <code>useId</code> for React list
          keys. It’s designed for IDs needed at the DOM level, not for uniquely
          identifying React list items.
        </p>
        <h2>New and Notable: React 19 Hooks</h2>
