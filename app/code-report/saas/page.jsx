        </h2>

        <p>
          Many years ago—long before most readers of this article were even on
          the family plan—software lived in a vastly different world. Imagine
          strolling into a physical store, picking out a shiny box containing a
          CD or, for those with a taste for nostalgia, a floppy disk. You'd
          saunter home, pop the disk into your computer, and voilà—the software
          was yours to keep, forever. That was true digital ownership, a utopia
          by today's standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then, as legend would have it, the devil applied for a job as a
          product manager at a software company. His big idea? Software as a
          Service, or SaaS. Now, instead of buying software, you rent
          it—forever, or at least as long as you pay that monthly fee. It's like
          leasing your own car, but the moment you miss a payment, it vanishes
          from your garage and takes your files with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We all saw what happened next: profits for these companies
          skyrocketed. Now, software companies are squeezing the lemon even
          harder. Peloton, for example, is infamous for charging a 95%
          "reactivation fee" if you dare to buy a used bike from Craigslist.
          Logitech is reportedly toying with a "pay as you go" mouse—bringing an
          entirely new meaning to "pay-per-click." Adobe, a name that makes the
          average creative professional anxious, was recently sued by the FTC
          for its predatory, hidden early termination fees.
        </p>
        <p>
          It can feel like nowhere is safe from the SaaS fever. Well, almost
          nowhere—TempleOS, that elusive outlier, doesn’t have this problem. But
          let’s face it, TempleOS isn’t exactly mainstream. The hard truth is
          that, in a free market, no one is forcing you to buy into these
          relentless subscriptions. The best way to escape subscription hell?
          Embrace free and open source software alternatives—the very existence
          of which most big companies would prefer you never discover.
        </p>
        <p>
          And before we reveal these hidden gems, here's a quick battle cry: go
          ahead and obliterate that like button and hoist the subscription
          button’s head on a pike—the channel will thank you (and so will any
          content creator suffering under SaaS tyranny).
        </p>

        <h2>Microsoft Office: Schoolyard Gateway to Subscription Addiction</h2>
        <p>
          Right after Windows itself, perhaps no software has been as ruthlessly
          profitable as Microsoft Office. The genius? Hook the kids
          early—elementary schoolers learn to tinker with Word, Excel, and
          PowerPoint, so by the time they’re grown, they’re spinning the hamster
          wheels of productivity, fueling Microsoft’s steady profits.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there’s hope. Enter <strong>LibreOffice</strong>, an open source
          suite that can go toe-to-toe with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
          LibreOffice supports a mind-boggling number of file formats, including
          DOCX, which Microsoft themselves sometimes struggle to open reliably.
          But perhaps the best features of LibreOffice are the ones it{" "}
          <em>lacks</em>: there’s no required internet connection stealing
          glances at your privacy, no documents automatically whisked away to
          the cloud (and future data breaches), and—blissfully—no intrusive AI
          “assistance” buried in every menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          Craving those missing “features”? By all means, keep that Microsoft
          subscription going. But if you yearn for digital freedom, LibreOffice
          is your hero.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Escape SaaS Traps: Airtable, Notion, and Their Open Source Twins
        </h2>
        <p>
          Many teams, successfully outlasting Microsoft Office, make a hasty
          retreat into other paid tools like Airtable—admittedly an awesome
          platform, but at $45 per month <em>per seat</em>, it’s not for the
          faint of wallet. Here’s the kicker: hundreds of users can collaborate
          on your own cloud-based version for mere dollars a month by
          self-hosting <strong>NoCodeDB</strong>. Data lives in your favorite
          SQL database, but gets transformed into rich, spreadsheet-style
          tables. Ideal for any kind of collaboration your boss can dream up.
        </p>
        <p>
          When your boss inevitably tells you to “stop, collaborate, and
          listen,” the team will probably reach for a note-taking app like
          Notion, again burning another $10 each month. Enter{" "}
          <strong>AppFlowy</strong>, the open source upstart written in Rust and
          Flutter. The UI is easy on the eyes, handles notes, Kanban boards,
          calendars, and more. Notion's latest gimmick was jamming AI
          everywhere; AppFlowy lets you add your own LLM provider, so you
          control the AI (not the other way around).
        </p>

        <h2>How to Discover These Open Source Wonders?</h2>
        <p>
          You might wonder: with all these incredible alternatives, where do you
          find out about them? One invaluable resource is{" "}
          <strong>daily.dev</strong>, today’s sponsor and also a free and open
          source project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daily.dev curates the top developer content on the Internet and helps
          you fine-tune your interests by joining “Squads”—tight-knit groups of
          fellow developers openly discussing the trends, tricks, and
          technologies you care about most. You won’t just find anonymous
          usernames lurking in the shadows; this is a real community where
          networking might even help you land that next big gig. Whether you’re
          a budding coder or just tech-curious, daily.dev is a goldmine—bookmark
          it and check it daily!
        </p>

        <h2>Salesforce & Slack: Open Source Giants on the Rise</h2>
        <p>
          Next up is another megalith: <strong>Salesforce</strong>. Their
          customer relationship management (CRM) software makes it easy for
          sales professionals everywhere to—how should we put this—
          <em>strategically annoy you</em> into buying something. Of the many
          open source CRMs, <strong>ERPNext</strong> shines. Not only does it
          handle CRM duties, but also serves as a full enterprise resource
          planning tool, tackling accounting, quality control, and more. Written
          in Python, ERPNext uses its own custom web framework (Frappe), and can
          be running via Docker in mere minutes—potentially saving your company
          millions in Salesforce contracts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Salesforce also recently snapped up <strong>Slack</strong> in a $27
          billion mega-acquisition. But, you don’t <em>need</em> to pay for team
          chat: check out <strong>Mattermost</strong>, powered by Go and
          TypeScript. Deploy it as a single binary with a Postgres backend, and
          enjoy not just rich chat features, but integrated voice and video
          calls too. With web, Android, iOS, and desktop clients, Mattermost
          returns full control of your messaging data—you own your workspace,
          and never have to pay a ransom to get your data back.
        </p>

        <h2>Zoomed Out? Meet Jitsi</h2>
        <p>
          And what about video conferencing? Many find themselves paying for{" "}
          <strong>Zoom</strong>, even though it doesn’t store data itself.
          During the pandemic, you could scramble to build your own video
          calling platform using WebRTC and JavaScript—but honestly, why trouble
          yourself? Enter <strong>Jitsi</strong>, a mature, open source video
          calling solution. It leverages WebRTC for voice and video, and boasts
          features like mobile apps, "raise hand," polls, virtual backgrounds,
          and the full suite of creature comforts you’d expect from its

        <h2>Replacing Jira and Backend: Plane & Open Source Bas</h2>
        <p>
          To our beleaguered professional developers: has your Scrum Master
          forced you through the tortures of Jira? Sprints, epics, burndowns,
          and mountains of tickets are standard, but the good news is{" "}
          <strong>Plane</strong> has swooped in—a free and open source
          alternative purposely designed to bring just as much (if not more)
          structure to your agile development lifecycle. Painful? Absolutely.
          Expensive? Not anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you’re building a modern app, there’s a good chance you’re using a
          backend-as-a-service—sometimes jokingly called the Big Ass Backend
          (BaaS). It’s hard to resist the allure of tools like Firebase, but the
          price and vendor lock-in can be daunting. Today, you have a
          smorgasbord of open source options:{" "}
          <strong>Convex, AppWrite, Supabase, PocketBase</strong>—and a
          lesser-known gem called <strong>Instant</strong>. While not a full
          backend, Instant is fantastic for real-time chat or collaboration
          apps, handling all the headaches of real-time client-server syncing.
        </p>

        <h2>Cutting the Cloud Hosting Cord</h2>
        <p>
          Hosting a website is a rite of passage for modern developers, and
          while you <em>could</em> pay top dollar to Vercel or Heroku for
          convenience, you can avoid subscription taxes with open source tools
          like <strong>Koolify</strong> (a Vercel alternative) or{" "}
          <strong>Dokku</strong> (a Heroku alternative). These tools let you
          host all your favorite open source apps on a single virtual private
          server, keeping the slick UI and APIs, but leaving the recurring bills
          and unwelcome surprise "free tier" removals behind.
        </p>

        <h2>Adobe: King of Subscription Greed—But There’s Hope</h2>
        <p>
          And finally, the crowning jewel of SaaS greed: <strong>Adobe</strong>.
          As this article was being crafted, Adobe Premiere was swallowing $59
          every month from the author’s wallet—which says something about the
          company’s grip on creative professionals. But alternatives <em>do</em>{" "}
          exist:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>DaVinci Resolve</strong> for video editing in place of
            Premiere
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Krita</strong> as a free digital painting and illustration
            replacement for Illustrator
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Blender</strong> for motion graphics and VFX, replacing
            After Effects
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The message is clear: for every SaaS product in your workflow, there
          is a free and open source, self-hosted alternative.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts: The Path (and Challenge) Ahead</h2>
        <p>
          Will never paying for software again be easy? Hardly. But as
          developers and technologists, we don’t do things because they’re
          easy—we do them because we <em>thought</em> they would be easy.
        </p>

          Thanks for reading, and remember: digital freedom is never further
          than a download away. See you in the next article!
