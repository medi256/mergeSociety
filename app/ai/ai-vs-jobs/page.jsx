        </h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Let’s get real about coding.</strong> If you’re still grinding
          through lines of code, hoping for your breakthrough app, it may be
          time to put down the keyboard. Why? Because the tech landscape has
          shifted so dramatically, what once was a gold rush now often feels
          like a race to the bottom. I’m here to make the case that learning to
          code and relying on tech jobs may not be your ticket to success—or
          even job security—in today’s world.
        </p>

        <h2>Stop Coding, Start Thinking: The Harsh Reality for Programmers</h2>
        <p>
          Let’s address the elephant in the room: Coding is no longer the
          hot-ticket meal everyone thinks it is. You’ve heard it all before—apps
          are dead, coding is passé, and yet, people keep at it. I run into
          programmers all the time, usually hustling for their next job, broke,
          and stuck in a loop. Why? Because, for many, coding is no longer the
          golden passport to high living. If you’re lucky enough to be employed,
          you’re often facing the cold facts: two weeks of vacation a year (if
          you're even allowed time off), needing permission for every minor
          activity, and, frankly, living more like a cog than a creator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even Barack Obama acknowledged the 'Learn to Code' movement’s time is
          up. AI models are already outperforming 60-70% of coders! Eric
          Schmidt, Google’s former CEO, predicts the vast majority of
          programmers will be replaced by AI within a year. So, when people ask,
          “What language are you coding in?”—well, honestly, it doesn’t matter
          anymore.
        </p>

        <h2>The Tech Dream Is Fading Fast</h2>
        <p>
          Splashy tech perks and Silicon Valley dreams? Those are relics. Just
          last week, Google announced its remote workers must return to the
          office at least three days a week—or lose their jobs. Why? Because
          tech giants are slashing costs left and right. The bonanza days are
          over; now, if you’re dancing for tech giants, you’re grinding harder
          than ever with less in return. Tech companies want 60-hour
          workweeks—Sergey Brin, Google’s co-founder, outright told AI workers
          60 hours is expected for peak productivity. There’s no overtime pay;
          you’re just supposed to be grateful for employment. The grind has a
          new name: 996, which means 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week—72 hours
          in reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, mass layoffs sweep the sector: Intel trimmed 20% of its
          workforce (about 20,000 people), Meta announced repeated layoffs
          across its divisions, with thousands cut just this year. AI isn’t just
          threatening programming jobs; it's devouring them. Check out the top
          posts on Reddit’s CS careers board: new computer science graduates are
          calling it a bloodbath. Stories abound of folks landing “dream” jobs
          in Big Tech, only to find relentless pressure, impossible standards,
          constant layoffs, and brutal burnout. Multiple posts reveal grads
          applying to hundreds of jobs with no luck, hiding unemployment from
          families out of shame, and only landing roles through nepotism or
          connections.
        </p>

        <h2>Globalization, Outsourcing, and the New Reality</h2>
        <p>
          If AI doesn’t take your job, outsourcing might. As Apple shifts iPhone
          production from China to India, there’s little sign of those
          manufacturing jobs returning to the U.S.—not when labor is cheaper and
          more dependable abroad. Not only do you compete with AI and global
          workers, but also with an abundance of other applicants, including
          Reddit moderators hunting for the same limited roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why throw yourself into this mess? The programming “dream” is starting
          to feel less like a career and more like a modern form of serfdom.
        </p>

        <h2>Progress Stalls: The Tech Stagnation and the AI Mirage</h2>
        <p>
          Let’s call it: Tech innovation has been stagnant for a decade. The
          much-desired leap to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) remains
          elusive—a recent Anthropic paper revealed that today’s AI is mostly
          advanced pattern-matching, not intelligence. So-called progress is
          really an illusion of smarts, not the real deal.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, AI agents will flat out “hallucinate” their way through
          tasks, often claiming to use tools or follow steps they never touched.
          Meta’s legendary researcher Yann LeCun admitted: every time a paradigm
          promises human-level AI in ten years, it turns out false. Bigger
          models and more data don’t make for better reasoning. If the AI bubble
          bursts, what’s left? We’ll be right back to mobile apps and
          microtransactions—dark UX patterns and 30% app store taxes, fighting
          for scraps in a landscape dominated by gatekeepers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The past decade’s trendy pivots—Web3, NFTs, the Metaverse,
          VR/AR—either fizzled or imploded. With each flop, the industry’s
          confidence eroded. Even Google’s latest move—a $70 billion stock
          buyback—shows a reluctance to reinvest in innovation. Instead of
          building, they’re giving cash back to investors, signaling a vacuum of
          ideas and direction.
        </p>

        <h2>Tariffs, De-Globalization, and Economic Headwinds</h2>
        <p>
          The tech sector’s challenges are compounded by mounting tariffs and
          deglobalization. Elon Musk recently noted China’s stranglehold isn’t
          in raw material supply, but in their unmatched ability to refine and
          manufacture rare earths—critical for robotics and electronics. Without
          China’s heavy industry, western robotics could stall for another two
          to three decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Container shipping from China to the U.S. is down 30% year-over-year;
          the Flexport CEO reports that bookings industry-wide are down 60%. As
          shipping production and imports collapse, the impact—estimated at a $2
          trillion hit to U.S. retail goods—could be felt as soon as supplies
          run out, potentially causing empty store shelves reminiscent of
          pandemic lockdowns. The message to businesses? Preserve cash and
          prepare for turbulence.
        </p>

        <h2>The Ghost of Web3 and the Rise of Stablecoins</h2>
        <p>
          There was a moment—not long ago—when Web3 threatened to become the
          next revolution, creating millions of jobs and birthing entirely new
          paradigms in tech, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to tokenized
          assets. But regulatory crackdowns choked the movement before it could
          blossom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet the embers of Web3 smolder on, with the stablecoin revolution
          poised to break into the mainstream within a year or two. According to
          Citibank, stablecoins could hit a $3.7 trillion market cap by
          2030—that’s a projected 20x leap from today. Stablecoin issuers like
          Tether, who reaped $13 billion in profits last year, are leading this
          charge, and even the U.S. Federal Reserve is relaxing rules around
          banks holding cryptocurrencies. Stripe, the payments giant, is
          preparing its own stablecoin infrastructure after acquiring
          Bridge—think of it as global money movement, stable and fast, with
          regulatory guardrails built in. Meanwhile, PayPal and Coinbase are
          pushing their own stablecoins, launching a full-on race for dominance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, is launching its own “Unichain,”
          pulling in $400 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) and outpacing
          Ethereum’s mainnet in active addresses. Even MetaMask, a staple in the
          Ethereum ecosystem, now allows users to pay gas fees using stablecoins
          like USDC or DAI, easing the complexity for newcomers and signaling a
          shift away from traditional Ethereum transactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want in on the action, liquidity mining rewards on Uniswap are
          offering eye-watering yields—89% APY, for example, on certain pairs
          (like USDC/wrapped Bitcoin), though these are fleeting promotional
          rates. This influx of on-chain funds will likely spiral upward, with
          bitcoin taking its role as the reserve asset—think digital gold,
          central to the new financial order.
        </p>

        <h2>Bitcoin: The Unstoppable Reserve Asset</h2>
        <p>
          The smart money isn’t holding onto fiat currencies for growth; it’s
          flowing into bitcoin. Bitcoin—currently hovering in the $95K range
          (and routinely breaching $100K)—remains one of the few open investment
          plays comparable to an early-stage startup, but accessible to the
          general public instead of just venture capital insiders. The long-term
          trend? Unbroken. Some see bitcoin overtaking gold as the world’s
          foremost store of value. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s CEO, predicts
          governments will eventually hold bitcoin as a reserve, its share
          rising to, or even surpassing, that of gold.
        </p>

        <h2>AI vs. Bitcoin: A Clash of Capital</h2>
        <p>
          There’s a fundamental clash brewing: Will capital flow to AI and its
          infinite infrastructure needs, or toward bitcoin’s promise of
          preservation? The fact is, there isn’t enough capital for both to
          reach their wildest dreams. And, between the two, bitcoin looks far
          less like a bubble than AI. If that turns out wrong, well, you’ll find
          me “going down with the ship.”
        </p>
        <h2>Modern Serfdom and the Blockchain Cementing Class</h2>
        <p>
          Think back to the medieval period: Serfs were bound to poverty, their
          social status determined by birth. Breakout mobility was a pipe dream.
          The same dynamic may be playing out today. The bitcoin revolution is
          happening in real-time, and the real opportunity lies in stacking BTC
          for generational wealth. Meanwhile, most folks are tunneling through
          “Hello World” tutorials in Java, wrestling with basic React apps, or
          working on blogging platforms like it’s 2007.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why not blockchain development?" skeptics ask. Complaints abound
          about its novelty and frontier risks, but maybe sticking to
          yesterday’s tech is why you’re still hustling for scraps. As long as
          bitcoin’s price holds steady, those early to adopt could see their
          socioeconomic status locked into the blockchain—potentially for
          generations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s the rub: The blockchain is immutable. There’s no digital lord
          to revolt against, like the peasants’ Great Rising in 1381. This
          ledger will preserve the status quo for the foreseeable future. If
          you’re not investing or adapting, chances are your family will remain
          in economic stasis throughout generations—a modern take on hereditary
          poverty, but now traced and recorded for all time.
        </p>
        <h2>
          The Takeaway: Code, Don’t Code—You’re Still Stuck Without Vision
        </h2>
        <p>
          So whether you pour your energy into coding or not, your outcomes are
          increasingly determined by greater economic forces beyond your
          individual effort. Born poor? The brutal message: You might die poor,
          unless you spot and seize those rare transformative opportunities as
          they surface, like the bitcoin revolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s the unfiltered truth. If you’re still broke and stuck, the
          explanation might be in plain sight. The future? It waits for no one.
          See you on the other side.
