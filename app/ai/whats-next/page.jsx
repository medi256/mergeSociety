        </h2>

        <p>
          When Demis Hassabis clinched the Nobel Prize last year, he didn't
          celebrate with the customary champagne toast or a black-tie gathering.
          Instead, true to his playful roots, Hassabis opted for a high-stakes
          poker game with a world chess champion. This love for games—chess,
          cards, computers—has propelled the 48-year-old British scientist into
          the very heart of artificial intelligence. He isn't just an AI
          pioneer; he is the co-founder and CEO of DeepMind, Google's AI
          powerhouse shaping our future one algorithm at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our journey with Hassabis began two years ago in a modest London
          office, just as chatbots were dazzling the world with their natural
          language trickery. Today, the conversation has shifted: Hasabis and
          his peers are chasing down artificial general intelligence (AGI)—a
          silicon intellect as versatile as a human, but amplified by superhuman
          speed and an encyclopedic memory. After the whirlwind of a Nobel Prize
          victory and being knighted by King Charles, we returned to London to
          witness what the future looks like through the eyes of a genius who
          may quite literally be holding the cards of our collective destiny.
        </p>

        <h2>A Lifelong Fascination with the Mystery of Reality</h2>

        <p>
          For Hassabis, curiosity about the world isn't just part of the
          job—it's a lifelong passion. “Since I was a kid, I've been fascinated
          by the biggest questions: the meaning of life, the nature of
          consciousness, the nature of reality itself,” he reflects. He devoured
          stories of legendary scientists and philosophers, all the while
          yearning to push humanity’s knowledge ahead. For him, AI was always
          the ultimate tool—a means of expanding human understanding by
          constructing a mind that could learn, reason, and imagine beyond our
          natural limits.
        </p>

        <h2>AI's Exponential Leap Forward</h2>

        <p>
          We asked: Is AI progressing even faster than he once imagined?
          Hassabis’s eyes light up, “It’s moving incredibly fast. I think we are
          on some kind of exponential curve of improvement.” With each
          headline-grabbing breakthrough, the field attracts more talent, more
          investment, and more resolve—intensifying the feedback loop driving
          this exponential growth. “It’s straight up. And increasing speed of
          progress.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Two years ago, we glimpsed the future with fledgling chatbots. Today,
          conversational AI is much more than an Internet-trained parrot. Enter
          Project Astra.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Astra: Giving AI Sight, Sound, and Empathy</h2>

        <p>
          Meet Astra: an AI companion that doesn’t just talk—it sees, hears, and
          interprets the world, blurring the boundary between machine and human
          interaction. On a brisk London afternoon, we sat with product manager
          Bebo Xu to test Astra’s powers.
        </p>

        <p>
          We challenged Astra with virtual paintings—artworks it had never seen
          before. One by one, we presented images on a screen:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>July Hay</strong> by Thomas Hart Benton (1942)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Virgin of Charity</strong> by El Greco
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Automat</strong> by Edward Hopper
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Astra not only identified each painting and artist correctly, but
          delivered insightful interpretations. “The subject in the painting
          appears pensive and contemplative, her expression suggesting a sense
          of solitude,” Astra observed about Hopper’s <i>Automat</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pushing further, we asked Astra to spin a story about the lone woman
          at the diner. Instantly, Astra painted a scene of melancholy: a cold
          city evening, Eleanor, lost in thought, dreams uncertain. “The scene
          freezes in time. Only the flow of ideas moving onward,” Astra
          declared. The poetic line hung in the air, remarkable for having been
          composed by code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yet even with impressive feats, Astra showed a distinctly human
          limitation—tone. When prompted about Astra’s seemingly abrupt “ah” in
          dialogue, the AI apologized, explaining, “My aim is always to engage
          thoughtfully.” Like a person, Astra’s responses reflect the immediate
          context, sometimes in ways that weren’t anticipated or directly
          programmed.
        </p>

        <h2>How AI Learns – And Surprises Even Its Creators</h2>

        <p>
          Unlike traditional software, AI programs like Astra learn by exploring
          vast jungles of digital data. “We have theories about what kinds of
          capabilities these systems will have... But at the end of the day, how
          it learns—what it picks up from the data—is part of the training,”
          Hassabis explains. “It learns like a human being would learn. So new
          capabilities or properties can emerge from that training situation.”
        </p>

        <p>
          That unpredictability, the emergence of skills programmers never
          explicitly coded, excites and unnerves in equal measure. “It’s the
          duality of these types of systems,” Hassabis acknowledges. They can
          accomplish feats never foreseen by their makers, but ensuring we truly
          grasp the knowledge slumbering inside their datasets remains a
          challenge.
        </p>

        <h2>Beyond Perception: Gemini and the Push for AGI</h2>

        <p>
          DeepMind’s latest AI model, Gemini, isn’t just content to observe the
          world. It’s being trained to act in it: booking tickets, shopping
          online, and ultimately serving as an intelligent assistant embedded in
          everyday life. “On track for AGI in the next five to ten years, I
          think,” Hassabis predicts. By 2030, he envisions a system “that really
          understands everything around you in very nuanced and deep ways.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Imagine this: wearable AI — like Astra integrated into eyeglasses.
          Picture walking through Coal Drops Yard, a London shopping district.
          You look at an old brick building, and a soft voice in your ear
          whispers its history: “This was once a set of Victorian coal
          warehouses, a hub for distributing coal across London.” Ask about coal
          pollution, and your AI companion gives you a brisk lesson on the
          Industrial Revolution. In this scenario, the only human contribution
          to the partnership is, as Hassabis jokes, “our legs”—and even
          locomotion, he admits, will soon be engineered.
        </p>

        <h2>The Next Leap: Robotics and Reasoning</h2>

        <p>
          Robotics is poised for its own breakthrough. Hassabis believes that in
          the coming years, we’ll see demonstrations of humanoid or otherwise
          capable robots doing real, useful work. To illustrate, DeepMind
          researchers Alex Lee and Giulia Vasani showcased a robot that not only
          recognizes what it sees but reasons through open-ended tasks.
        </p>

        <p>
          We watched as the robot was instructed: "Put the blocks whose color is
          the combination of yellow and blue into the matching color ball." The
          robot paused only momentarily before deducing that yellow and blue
          make green—then acted accordingly. It’s not parroting an instruction;
          it’s reasoning, live and unscripted.
        </p>

        <h2>From Chessboards to Protein Maps: A Mind Made for AI</h2>

        <p>
          Hassabis’s fascination with logic and strategy started early. While
          other children stacked blocks, he maneuvered chess pieces—rising to #2
          in the world for his age by twelve. This passion led him to study
          computer chess, design video games, and eventually, to forge thinking
          machines. Born to a Greek Cypriot father and Singaporean mother,
          Hassabis’s academic journey ran through Cambridge, MIT, and Harvard.
          He pursued a PhD in neuroscience, reasoning that to build an
          artificial mind, first he must understand the human brain.
        </p>

        <h2>The Quest for Machine Consciousness</h2>

        <p>
          Are today’s AI systems truly self-aware? “I don’t think any of today’s
          systems feel self-aware or conscious in any way,” Hassabis says. Could
          they become so? Theoretically, yes—but it isn’t an explicit goal. “It
          may happen implicitly. These systems might acquire some feeling of
          self-awareness… But if a machine becomes self-aware,” he muses, “we
          may not recognize it.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Here’s the crux: We judge each other’s consciousness because we share
          the same “substrate”—the organic stuff of carbon and water and squishy
          brains. But machines are silicon-based. Even if they walk, talk, and
          think like us, we may never know if their sensations match our own.
        </p>

        <h2>
          What Makes AI Truly Intelligent? Curiosity, Imagination, Intuition
        </h2>

        <p>
          Has an AI ever asked a question that surprised even Hassabis? “Not so
          far that I’ve experienced,” he admits. That’s what’s still missing:
          the spark of true curiosity, the ability to ask a novel question or
          form a hypothesis no human has considered. “They’re probably lacking a
          little bit in what we would call imagination and intuition. But they
          will have greater imagination, he says, and soon.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Hassabis believes that in the next five to ten years, AI may not just
          solve long-standing scientific problems—it’ll propose the problems
          itself, conjuring breakthrough questions before we could even imagine
          them.
        </p>

        <h2>The Breakthrough: AlphaFold and the Protein Puzzle</h2>

        <p>
          Hassabis’s most celebrated contribution—the one that earned him the
          Nobel Prize—was building AlphaFold, an AI model that cracked biology’s
          hardest code: predicting the 3D structure of proteins. Proteins are
          the essential molecules behind every function in the human body, from
          neurons firing to muscles twitching—all orchestrated by proteins
          folding into intricate shapes.
        </p>

        <p>
          For decades, scientists had mapped less than 1% of protein structures;
          determining each one took years of painstaking research. Then,
          AlphaFold swept onto the scene, producing the shapes of 200 million
          proteins in just one year—an accomplishment believed impossible only a
          few years ago.
        </p>

        <p>
          The impact is seismic. Hassabis’s AI is now accelerating drug design,
          shrinking timelines from the standard ten years and billions in
          investment to mere months or even weeks. “It would revolutionize human
          health,” Hassabis says, almost offhand. “And I think one day maybe we
          can cure all disease with the help of AI. The end of disease. I think
          that’s within reach.”
        </p>

        <h2>Radical Abundance—and Existential Risk</h2>

        <p>
          AI's potential doesn’t end at human health. Hassabis envisions a world
          of “radical abundance,” where scarcity is conquered and resources are
          plentiful. But with great power comes sweeping risk.
        </p>

        <p>
          What keeps him up at night? Two things: first, “bad actors”—humans who
          twist AI for malicious purposes. Second, the potential for powerful AI
          systems to slip outside human control as they become more autonomous.
          Can we guarantee they’ll always be aligned with human values, doing
          what’s best for society? Guardrails—ethical boundaries coded into the
          system—are mission critical. But in the global race for AI dominance,
          Hassabis fears, safety could take a back seat.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Of course, all of this energy and racing and resources is great for
          progress, but it might incentivize certain actors to cut corners. And
          one of the corners that can be shortcut would be safety and
          responsibility.”
        </p>

        <p>
          This isn’t just Google or DeepMind’s problem. “AI is going to affect
          every country, everybody in the world. So I think it’s really
          important that the world and the international community has a say in
          this,” Hassabis urges.
        </p>

        <h2>Can Morality Be Programmed?</h2>

        <p>
          Is it even possible to teach machines morality? Hassabis is
          optimistic. “I think you can. They learn by demonstration, they learn
          by teaching. We have to give them a value system and some
          guardrails—much in the way that you would teach a child.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, Google DeepMind is locked in a fierce contest with dozens of
          competitors to build AGI so human-like you can’t tell the difference.
          But it raises a mind-bending question: When Hassabis signed the Nobel
          Book of Laureates, who will sign next—the human…or the machine? And
          when that happens, will humans ever sign it again?
        </p>

        <h2>The Coming Age of Ubiquitous AI</h2>

        <p>
          “The next steps are going to be these amazing tools that enhance
          almost every endeavor we do as humans. And then beyond that, when AGI
          arrives, it’s going to change pretty much everything about the way we
          do things,” says Hassabis with both awe and caution. Our world will
          need a new generation of philosophers to help us navigate the
          transformative possibilities—and impossible questions—unleashed by
          artificial intelligence.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>
            From decoding protein structures to composing poetic tales about
            lonely diners, AI is evolving at dizzying speed. Soon, machines may
            be creating 3D worlds from images, or bringing your holiday photos
            to brightly animated life. As this future unfolds, one thing is
            certain: the flow of ideas is only moving onward.
