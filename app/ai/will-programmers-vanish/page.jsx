        <p>
          <strong>
            Which software jobs are disappearing, and which roles will thrive in
            an AI-driven future?
          </strong>{" "}
          If you’ve been pondering this question, you’re in good company. That’s
          exactly what veteran engineer Dave Plummer—best known for work
          stretching from MS-DOS to Windows 95—dives into, right from his
          famously inviting garage workshop. With over 40 years of experience
          that started in BASIC and assembly language and spanned the evolution
          through C, C++, JavaScript, and Python, Dave brings a rare perspective
          on how our field has transformed—and where it’s headed next.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>
            Meet Dave: Four Decades in Software (and Still Coding for Fun)
          </h2>
          <p>
            Dave reflects on his enduring passion for coding: “Would I do it all
            again? Of course! I've been incredibly fortunate—and I'd trade it
            all… for just a little bit more. I just love to code!” For Dave (and
            many like him), the thrill of building things hasn’t dulled, and
            being paid for it is just a bonus.
          </p>
          <p>
            But as a father whose son has just started a software engineering
            degree, Dave’s perspective is not just professional—it’s personal.
            “This advice is as much for my own family as it is for you,” he
            shares. And if you enjoy Dave’s style? He reminds you (with
            characteristic humor): “No Patreon here! I'm just in it for the subs
            and likes, so don’t forget to hit both and turn on notifications for
            future episodes.”
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Which Programming Jobs Are at Risk—and Which Will Survive?</h2>
          <p>
            “I'm less worried about any specific language or trendy area,” Dave
            begins. Instead, he’s focused on one thing:{" "}
            <strong>overall competence</strong>. He paints a picture—imagine the
            skills of all programmers graphed in a bell curve. Those at the far
            right? The most competent, the rare debug wizards? “They’re doing
            very well today and will be for a long, long time.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Here's the reality, Dave explains: Even if AI code generators like
            ChatGPT triple in their ability to churn out neat Python snippets,
            that’s not what the top engineers are doing all day. “If you’re the
            kind of person who can debug the call stack for an SRAM cache miss
            in an interrupt handler of a microcontroller—because of a reference
            counting bug in a shared pointer off in a library—you’re going to be
            okay. There just aren’t many humans who are excellent at debugging
            those kinds of complex synchronization issues. And it’ll be a long
            time before AI can handle it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            But what if your job mostly involves small, repetitive tweaks? “If
            you're the person assigned to change the year in the mail-merge
            header every January... well, maybe it's time to think about truck
            driving school." And with a chuckle, Dave acknowledges that even
            trucks might drive themselves soon. “Actually, I think they'll run
            in convoys, with a pro driver in the front like a train engineer.
            Fewer truckers, but with higher-end skills. And programming will be
            similar.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The key point:{" "}
            <strong>
              The difference between programming and trucking is that AI-driven
              programming is about to explode.
            </strong>{" "}
            Even if half of today's programming jobs vanish, just as many—or
            more—may be created to harness the power of AI. The field is on the
            cusp of transformation, not extinction.

          <h2>Programming Isn’t Just About Writing Code</h2>
          <p>
            Here’s a nuance that’s lost in most discussions: Being a valuable
            software engineer is <em>barely</em> about with banging out line
            after line of code. Drawing on his own tenure, Dave estimates: “I
            spent, at best, 20% of my time coding. The other 80%? Debugging and
            validating that code.” That’s not because of poor code quality—it’s
            because “with rare exceptions, like my personal projects Task
            Manager and Zip folders, I wasn’t writing brand-new code. Good-money
            gigs for cranking out fresh main.cpp files are surprisingly few.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, Dave describes real engineering work—a year spent porting
            the Windows 95 shell over to Windows NT. That job was{" "}
            <strong>
              all about creative problem-solving for backward and forward
              compatibility
            </strong>
            :
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Unicode compatibility:</strong> Making sure file shortcuts
              created on Windows 95 (using ASCII) would still work on NT (using
              Unicode), and vice versa—even after renaming shortcuts to complex
              kanji strings.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Zero room for errors:</strong> If shortcuts taken from a
              floppy disk didn’t work or, worse, crashed Windows 95, they
              couldn’t fix it with an update—the older OS was "carved in stone."
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            “Every aspect of the interaction had to be handled on the NT side,
            in a way that was backward compatible but forward-looking. It wasn’t
            mainly about writing code—it was{" "}
            <strong>figuring out what code even had to be written</strong>.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Dave predicts: In a few years, AI will handle the grunt work—the
            easy 90% of porting. But the tough parts, like subtle compatibility
            and making nuanced trade-offs, will be a “very human problem.”
          </p>

          <h2>The Evolving Role: From Coding to AI Collaboration</h2>
          <p>
            Let’s imagine AI continues its current trajectory for another
            decade. What then? Dave believes it’s “probably a given” that AI
            will move from writing subroutines to full turnkey solutions and
            applications. At that point, the question becomes:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Will software engineers treat AI-created solutions as “black
              boxes”?
            </li>
            <li>
              Or will they jump in, debug the underlying code, or revise the
              AI’s <em>specification</em> and output until it’s just right?
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Either way, the future still involves an engineer collaborating with
            AI—tuning requirements, testing results, and ensuring the solution
            matches the need. For the next few years, Dave foresees vast source
            code trees with lots of AI-generated and AI-assisted code long
            before the era of fully-formed, test-passing, customer-ready apps.
            “Some of the more mundane programming jobs that don’t require a lot
            of skill will go away. But new, technical jobs will appear—like
            being the liaison between the customer and the AI, writing prompts,
            and tuning the software output.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Bottom line:{" "}
            <strong>
              Many entry-level programming jobs will be replaced by AI, but the
              future for software engineers is still incredibly bright.

          <h2>Where Human Programmers Still Shine: Your Competitive Edge</h2>
          <p>So, why will skilled engineers remain essential?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Complex problem-solving:</strong> AI still cannot
              independently tackle unstructured, deeply creative problems that
              demand innovation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Human insight and intuition:</strong> A big part of
              engineering is understanding human needs, behaviors, and
              preferences—something AI, lacking intuition, struggles to design
              around.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ethics and nuanced decision-making:</strong> Many
              decisions require judgment and sensitivity to social
              norms—territory where human values trump algorithms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Customization and personalization:</strong> Building
              software tailored to a client’s unique context demands deep,
              sometimes tacit knowledge that AI can’t yet fully parse.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>AI needs you:</strong> Ironically, the evolution of AI
              means that talented software engineers will be in even greater
              demand to design, build, and fine-tune AI itself.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In a nutshell: AI can automate and assist, but{" "}
            <strong>it won’t replace programmers entirely</strong>. Instead, it
            will push human engineers to focus on the most creative, complex,
            and interpersonal aspects of software—where our brains still have
            the upper hand.

          <h2>
            How to Secure Your Software Engineering Future (and Maximize Your
            Value)
          </h2>
          <p>
            Dave’s advice?{" "}
            <strong>
              “Be as far to the right on the competency curve as you can.”
            </strong>{" "}
            The jobs most likely to be displaced are the ones held by those on
            the lower end of the skill spectrum; the safest bet is to become
            indispensable.
          </p>
          <p>
            To illustrate, he shares a hypothetical: “Suppose you have a team of
            10 engineers porting old COBOL business code to a modern language.
            In two years, it might be an AI... and just three engineers to run
            it. My take? Be in the top third, not the bottom.”
          </p>
          <p>
            There's still “plenty of gold in these hills,” Dave quips. But the
            easy days of snagging nuggets right from the stream are over. For
            the persistent and innovative, though, “it’s the beginning of a
            whole new gold rush.”

          <p>
            Dave closes by inviting your perspective: “I’d love to hear your
            thoughts. I do read all the comments.” In a personal aside, he
            points out his book on Asperger’s and ASD—aimed at anyone working
            with, living with, or managing someone on the spectrum, informed by
            his experience and lessons he wishes he'd learned sooner.
