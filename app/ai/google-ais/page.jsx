        </h2>

        <p>
          Last week, I ventured deep into the world of artificial intelligence
          by dedicating five hours and spending $49 on Google’s new AI
          Essentials course for beginners. My objective? To extract the most
          worthwhile insights, evaluate the course’s strengths and weaknesses,
          and, of course, answer the burning question: will the certificate
          increase your chances of… getting paid? (Not “laid”—that was a
          mischievous slip. But hey, if knowledge and new skills improve your
          professional and personal prospects, more power to you.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Here, I’ll share the five biggest takeaways from the course, break
          down who the course is really for, and give you the candid truth about
          whether Google’s shiny certification is actually worth your
          investment.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Takeaway #1: The Three Types of AI Tools—And When You’ll Use Them
        </h2>
        <p>
          Let’s start by establishing some foundational knowledge. According to
          Google’s course, there are three broad categories of AI tools that
          you’ll see popping up everywhere:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Standalone AI Tools:</strong> These are AI-powered apps or
            software that operate independently and require minimal setup. Think
            familiar chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity.
            You’ll also find specialized apps such as Speeco (for voice
            transcription), Otter (for meetings), Midjourney (for image
            generation), and Gamma (for slide decks and presentations). Despite
            their different purposes, they’re called “standalone” because you
            can use them directly via their websites or apps—no need to hook
            them into other software or services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Tools with Integrated AI Features:</strong> These are
            regular programs you probably already use, like Google Docs or
            Google Slides, but supercharged with AI enhancements. For instance,
            after drafting a document in Google Docs, you could either
            copy-paste the text into a standalone AI tool like ChatGPT for
            suggestions, or you could use Google’s integrated Gemini AI right
            within Docs to improve your writing. Similarly, you might use
            Midjourney (standalone) for images, or generate them directly in
            Google Slides using its built-in AI. The key difference here:
            Standalone tools are their own destination, whereas integrated AI
            features enhance software you already use.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Custom AI Solutions:</strong> These are tailor-made AI
            applications designed to address specific business or organizational
            problems. For example, Johns Hopkins University developed an AI
            system specifically to detect sepsis in patients. The results were
            dramatic—increasing diagnostic accuracy from 2–5% all the way up to
            an average of 40%. And here’s a big misconception: you don’t need a
            computer science degree to benefit from custom AI. Well-designed
            solutions require little to no technical background for users. As
            someone who used to handle over 200 sales clients each quarter, I
            know firsthand how time-consuming research can be. Now, custom AI
            can ingest vast customer data, weigh factors like seasonality and
            industry trends, and recommend where a salesperson should focus
            their energy next. It’s all about empowering non-technical users
            with smart solutions.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          <strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you’re thinking of buying Google’s AI
          Essentials course, hold up! I discovered <em>after</em> I paid that
          you can actually get the AI Essentials course for free—with enrollment
          in Google’s Project Management Certification on Coursera. (Yes,
          Coursera is kindly sponsoring this portion of my recap.) As someone
          who works full time and dabbles in project management daily, I can
          confirm: this certification is now considered the gold standard in the
          field. If you’re aiming to be more organized and tech-savvy at work,
          definitely consider checking out the Google Project Management
          Certification through the link below. You’ll unlock the AI course for
          free, your wallet will thank you, and your resume will thank you even
          more.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Takeaway #2: Master Prompt Engineering by Surfacing Implied Context
        </h2>
        <p>
          On to a prompt engineering essential—surfacing the implied context.
          Let’s play out a scenario: your vegetarian friend asks for restaurant
          suggestions. Naturally, you’d recommend vegetarian-friendly places,
          even if they don’t spell it out for you. Their diet is the implied
          context guiding your response.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when you communicate with AI tools—like ChatGPT or Google
          Gemini—the AI doesn’t know your context unless you say it{" "}
          <strong>explicitly</strong>. If you’re prepping to negotiate a raise
          and last year you had a 10% bump, this year you’re a top performer,
          and the industry average is a 12% raise, you’d probably aim for 15%.
          If you ask an AI for negotiation advice without including this crucial
          backstory, you’ll get generic, less relevant results.
        </p>
        <p>
          So: always spell out your context and specifics when writing prompts.
          If you’re curious about prompt engineering, I’ve got a whole video on
          crafting the perfect prompt, plus a free workspace toolkit with my top
          five productivity prompts—links are down below.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Takeaway #3: When to Use Zero Shot, One Shot, and Few Shot Prompting
        </h2>
        <p>
          Here’s a term you’ll see thrown around in the AI world:{" "}
          <strong>shot</strong>. It just means “example.” Here’s the quick
          breakdown:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Zero Shot:</strong> Ask the AI to do something without
            giving any examples. <br />
            <em>Example:</em> “Write me a pickup line for Bumble.” (Purely
            hypothetical, of course.)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>One Shot:</strong> Provide a single example. <br />
            <em>Example:</em> “Write me a pickup line for Bumble. Here’s one my
            friend used that worked well: &lsquo;Are you a magician? Because
            whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears.&rsquo;”
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Few Shot:</strong> Provide two or more examples. The more
            quality examples, the better your results.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The takeaway: The more relevant examples you give, the more tailored
          and accurate the AI’s response will be. (For the record, if my future
          spouse is reading this: I’ve never used dating apps.{" "}
          <em>This is just for educational purposes.</em>)
        </p>

        <h2>Takeaway #4: Use Chain of Thought Prompting for Complex Tasks</h2>
        <p>
          One of my favorite insights from Google’s course is the concept of
          “chain of thought” prompting. It means breaking a big task down into
          smaller, manageable steps so the AI can guide you through each phase
          with precision.
        </p>
        <p>For example, if you need a cover letter:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Simple approach:</strong> Share your resume and job
            description in one big prompt, and ask the AI to draft your cover
            letter. You’ll get a generic result.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chain of thought approach:</strong> Ask the AI to write just
            the opening hook, based on your resume and the job description.
            Refine the hook. Then, paste it back in and ask for the body
            paragraph. Keep going step-by-step until you have the full package.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This not only results in a finer-tuned, more personal cover letter,
          but it also gives you full control at each step. Curious if it really
          works? I’ve documented this technique in a separate video,
          specifically for job seekers—find the link below.

        <h2>Takeaway #5: Always Understand the Limitations of AI</h2>
        <p>
          It’s tempting to treat AI as a miracle worker, but you need to be
          aware of three major limitations:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Bias:</strong> An AI is only as good as the data used
            to train it. If a text-to-image AI only sees minimalistic designs,
            it won’t understand how to make something bold and flashy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Knowledge Gaps:</strong> AI models have data cut-off dates
            and aren’t always up-to-date with the latest events. If you ask it
            about something that happened after its last training, results may
            be spotty or nonexistent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hallucinations:</strong> Sometimes, AI just makes things up
            (AKA “hallucinates”), offering answers that are factually incorrect.
            Sometimes that’s fine when you’re brainstorming. But it’s risky for
            high-stakes tasks—like figuring out which supplements to take for
            your health. Always double-check when your decisions matter.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
          Course Pros & Cons: Who Should (and Shouldn’t) Take Google’s AI
          Essentials?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Let’s get honest: This course <strong>isn’t for you</strong> if you
          already use AI tools like ChatGPT or Google Gemini daily and want
          deeper, advanced knowledge. The course has a solid overview of
          important concepts, but its real-world examples can be a little…
          vague. For instance, they mention a company using AI to reduce
          customer service wait times—and leave it at that. It would have been
          more helpful to clarify <em>how</em> the company used AI, whether it
          was standalone or custom, how the staff was trained, and how they
          ensured the AI didn’t hallucinate (especially when dealing with real
          customers).
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, this course is{" "}
          <strong>fantastic for beginners or visual learners</strong>, and here
          are three big reasons why:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Expertise:</strong> You’re learning directly from Google
            employees—people who live and breathe AI (and who probably don’t
            moonlight as YouTube comedians).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visual Explanations:</strong> The graphics and analogies are
            top-notch. For instance, they use the analogy of a car (AI tool) and
            its engine (AI model)—the model powers the tool, and the tool helps
            you complete your task. It’s simple, smart, and helps demystify
            complex concepts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Interactivity:</strong> The activities and graded
            assignments actually teach you core concepts. The quizzes are
            challenging enough that you can’t just click through—you’ll need
            real understanding to score the 80% pass mark.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Other benefits include a curated list of beginner-friendly AI tools
          and a handy glossary of today’s must-know AI vocabulary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bottom line: This course is a terrific jumping-off point for
          beginners, especially visual learners, job seekers, and the
          AI-curious. Plus, with a legitimate certificate from Google at the
          end, you’ll have something impressive to flash to potential
          employers—or, who knows, even prospective partners.
        </p>
