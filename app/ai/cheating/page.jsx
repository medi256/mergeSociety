        </h2>

        <p>
          There are two kinds of people in this world that I simply can’t trust:
          people who don’t sprinkle a healthy amount of swear words into their
          code comments, and people who don’t tell the truth. In the rapidly
          evolving landscape of remote work—and with the powerful emergence of
          large language models—one trend is all too clear: more and more
          candidates are trying to game the system during technical interviews.
          In fact, estimates suggest that up to 10% of interviewees now attempt
          some form of cheating. Today, let’s take a not-so-glamorous tour
          through the wildest cheating techniques hopeful developers employ to
          land that coveted, high-paying job in tech’s fiercely competitive
          sphere—as well as a sobering look at just how disastrous it can be
          when cheaters get caught.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>It is April 26, 2025, and you’re reading The Code Report.</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Role Models or Rule Breakers? A Quick Stroll Down Memory Lane</h2>
        <p>
          If we’re being honest, some of the people who inspired me as a kid
          weren’t exactly poster children for integrity—think Lance Armstrong,
          Barry Bonds, the entire Russian Olympic team (no, seriously—all of
          them), and Mike Tyson. Sure, all legendary athletes, but also, famous
          for “bending” rules in creative, if not always ethical, ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let’s be clear: I’m not advocating for biting your interviewer's
          ear off when you draw a blank on inverting a binary tree. But if we're
          willing to look at reality with unfiltered honesty, the competitive
          modern tech job market breeds—well—creative survival strategies.
          Sometimes they work, sometimes they spectacularly backfire, but make
          no mistake: cheating isn’t a new phenomenon, and it happens in
          practically every industry.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Academics:</strong> Plagiarize papers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Investors:</strong> Pull off Ponzi schemes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chess players:</strong> Allegedly (and, let’s be real,
            hilariously) transmit computer moves by using remote-controlled
            Morse code…directly to the sphincter. (Yes, really. You read that
            correctly.)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Now, while that last chess “enhancement” might be brilliant—if true—it
          probably wouldn’t fly in a coding interview. So what <em>does</em>{" "}
          work for would-be cheaters in tech? Let’s pull back the curtain.
        </p>

        <h2>The Low-Hanging Fruit: Cribbing Answers</h2>
        <p>
          Remember the age-old trick of jotting math equations in tiny pencil
          scribbles on your palm before a high school exam? In a remote
          technical interview, the digital equivalent is simple: keep a second,
          “off-webcam” laptop close at hand, loaded with browser tabs—each one
          opened to different LeetCode solutions and interview prep articles.
        </p>
        <p>
          This method isn’t exactly subtle or flawless. It works primarily
          because many technical interview questions are recycled endlessly. How
          many times have you heard of “FizzBuzz,” “invert a binary tree,” or
          “magical string”? If you’re lucky, you can quietly glance at the
          secret laptop, pull up the right answer, and nail the coding portion.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here’s the catch: technical interviews aren’t just about spewing
          correct code. They’re about demonstrating true understanding. If you
          fly through a problem without breaking a sweat yet can’t explain a
          single thing about how it works, the interviewer is going to have some
          thoughts:

            <li>Either you’re a socially awkward, 10x-developer unicorn, or</li>

          In a solid technical interview, you’re expected to walk through your
          thought process, make some mistakes, and iteratively work toward the
          solution—as you would in real life. Many candidates get tripped up not
          because they can’t code, but because their “borrowed” solution has
          left them clueless about what’s actually happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s also the simple statistical reality: if your secret laptop
          doesn’t have the answer to a new or rare question, you’re sunk.

        <h2>The Online Underground: Leaked Interview Questions</h2>
        <p>
          Moving up one rung on the cheating sophistication scale, we stumble
          into the digital underworld of leaked interview questions. While
          companies regularly update their question banks, people always manage
          to screenshot and share those prized queries—ferrying them to niche
          websites and secret Discord channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m not going to give you a directory of these places—actually, no,
          screw it. Leaked questions are everywhere. Try searching GitHub, or a
          somewhat cryptic Chinese website called{" "}
          <a
            href="https://1point3acres.com/"
            target="_blank"

          </a>
          . These platforms meticulously compile the most recently asked
          technical interview questions at household names like Meta, often
          boiled down to public LeetCode problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where things veer into the grey area is when{" "}
          <em>proprietary, non-standard</em> questions start leaking out into
          the wild. For those, tracking down the original source can sometimes
          be like following a digital treasure map—murky, borderline-ethical,
          and risky.
        </p>
        <p>
          But let’s be fair: talking shop with like-minded devs on reputable
          platforms <strong>isn’t</strong> the same as cheating. In fact, the
          sponsor of today’s video—Daily.dev—is a free, thriving social platform
          that curates the best developer content from across the internet and
          helps developers network. Why trawl through endless Reddit threads

        <h2>Friends Don’t Let Friends... Wait, Actually, They Might</h2>
        <p>
          But what if neither your LeetCode-surfing skills nor your
          leaked-question-archive binge is enough? Some candidates hire their
          friends to act as covert code whisperers. Picture this: during your
          remote interview, your trusted “bros” sit off-camera, ready to deliver
          answers in sign language. This ballet of hand-flapping must take place
          in person—screen sharing software is often detected, thanks to
          pre-screening tests built into most remote interviewing tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          The real obstacle, though? Most aspiring programmers don’t have a
          large enough friend circle to pull this off! Luckily, artificial
          intelligence has arrived to fill that gap.
        </p>

        <h2>Cheating with AI: ChatGPT, Claude, and the Future of Dishonesty</h2>
        <p>
          Modern AI tools have democratized cheating in ways we never imagined.
          Now, it’s not about having a wingman in your living room; it’s about
          screenshotting the challenge, feeding it to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini,
          or whatever new bot is trending, and watching an answer appear.
        </p>
        <p>
          But does this actually work? Earlier in 2024, Interviewio conducted a
          fascinating controlled study: interviewers were kept in the dark, with
          no idea that some candidates were using AI to “phone a friend.”
        </p>
        <p>Here’s what they found:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>On verbatim LeetCode questions</strong> (i.e., copy-pasted
            from public sources), cheaters passed 73% of the time—compared to
            53% for the control group.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>On modified LeetCode questions</strong> (tweaked or
            reframed), cheater pass rates dropped to about 60%, but still above
            the control.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>On custom, never-before-seen questions</strong>, cheaters
            flopped: only a 25% pass rate.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          While AI-generated solutions increasingly look legit, there’s a
          fundamental problem: those snippets often contain convincing rubbish.
          Try passing off a chunk of plausible-yet-totally-wrong code in a live
          interview, and your ruse will unravel spectacularly. That’s exactly
          what happened to a certain candidate who attempted to use Claude
          during an XAI interview—only to be called out by the interviewer, who
          then graciously explained how interview cheating happens in 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s important to highlight that this study is now over a year old,
          and AI tools have only gotten sharper at rapid-fire coding since then.
          Yet, the chilling twist? In this experiment, <strong>no one</strong>{" "}
          actually got caught in the act.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Cheating Is—Still—a Terrible Idea</h2>
        <p>
          Here’s the thing: wriggling past an AI-laden phone screen is just
          Round 1. Interview with a FANG company, and you’ll face an in-person
          gauntlet—complete with whiteboards and hovering interviewers—where
          your only hope for cheating is via a neural implant, a telepathic
          connection, or possibly (if you dare) a remote-controlled suppository.
        </p>
        <p>
          (If you manage to pull <em>that</em> level of sci-fi trickery off,
          honestly, maybe you’ve earned the job.)
        </p>
        <p>
          But reality bites: cheaters almost always get caught, and when they
          do, the price is steep. Here’s what’s really at stake:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Immediate rejection from the role—no appeals, no second chances.
          </li>
          <li>Blacklisting from future opportunities at that company.</li>
          <li>
            The tech world, for all its size, is surprisingly small: word gets
            around on Twitter, LinkedIn, and in private circles. A cheating
            scandal can stain your professional reputation—possibly forever.
          </li>
          <li>
            Deep personal embarrassment, and the kind of regret that will haunt
            you.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the off-chance you do snag the job, you’re likely to become a low
            performer, squarely in the crosshairs come layoff season.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          At the end of the day, cheating is not just a slip-up—it’s a conscious
          decision. As tempting as “hacking the system” might seem, the risks
          and consequences far outweigh the rewards.
