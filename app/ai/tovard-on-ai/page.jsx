        </h2>

        <p>
          Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly becoming an inescapable part
          of the world of software development. But how intelligent <em>is</em>{" "}
          “artificial intelligence,” really? As our conversation with Jim
          illustrates, the most influential advancements are being made through
          large language models (LLMs) the powerhouse technology behind many
          headline grabbing AI tools today.
        </p>

        <h2>What Are Large Language Models, Really?</h2>
        <p>
          When the hype around AI reaches a fever pitch, it’s easy to imagine
          these systems are thinking, self aware machines. But let's clear the
          air: LLMs are more like <strong>autocorrect on steroids</strong>.
          Their secret sauce? Predicting the *next most likely word* in a
          sentence at superhuman speeds, extrapolating based on patterns in
          enormous datasets. The result isn’t true intelligence, but as Jim
          points out, the impact on our daily lives is massively significant
          nonetheless.
        </p>

        <h2>Is AI Generated Code Already Among Us?</h2>
        <p>
          Here’s the million dollar question: will we soon see code written
          entirely by LLMs landing in your repository as a pull request? Jim is
          convinced it’s not only possible, but that it’s likely already
          happening albeit on a smaller scale for now. Developers are getting a
          “helping hand” from AI for routine coding tasks, and automation in
          coding isn’t exactly new. We’ve moved from machine code to assembler,
          from C to Rust, using tools that increase our productivity every step
          of the way. The difference now is the sophistication and potential
          reach of these new tools.
        </p>

        <p>
          So is this just another technical evolution, or the revolutionary
          change the media proclaims? Jim remains pragmatic: while it’s
          transformative, it’s not necessarily the paradigm shift proclaimed in
          every headline. For him, the true allure has always been the thrill of
          working close to the hardware digging into kernels and the lowest
          levels of computation far removed from high level, AI augmented
          abstraction.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Can AI Help Us Write <em>and</em> Review Code?
        </h2>
        <p>
          There’s plenty of excitement about using AI for coding, but what about
          one of the most challenging aspects of software engineering:{" "}
          <strong>code review and maintenance</strong>? The hope is real.
          Imagine an LLM as an eagle eyed assistant, tirelessly catching “stupid
          bugs” the kind that are so obvious, they often slip through unnoticed
          by humans. If you’re a developer, you probably recognize that a
          significant chunk of bugs in any codebase aren’t subtle at all.
          They’re simple oversights.
        </p>

        <p>
          Compilers already do a great job flagging the most blatant errors, but
          what about those <em>slightly</em> subtler mistakes a variable used
          incorrectly, a pattern that doesn’t match expectations? An LLM could
          flag inconsistencies, prompting developers with, “Are you sure this is
          what you meant?” Sometimes, it’s not and that simple prompt could
          prevent major headaches down the road.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “You call them disparagingly like autocorrects on steroids. And I
            actually think that they're way more than that… We all are
            autocorrects on steroids to some degree. And I see that as a tool
            that can help us be better at what we do. But I've always been
            optimistic.”
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>AI as a Tool: Hopeful, Helpful, and Humble</h2>

        <p>
          The sentiment here is one of guarded optimism. Sure, it takes a
          measure of bold hopefulness to think you can revolutionize something
          as fundamental as kernel development Jim jokes that 32 years ago, he
          was “stupid enough” to believe he could build a better kernel than
          anyone else. That hopeful optimism, he suggests, is the engine behind
          progress.
        </p>

        <p>
          In that spirit, the outlook on tools like LLMs is positive: they’re{" "}
          <strong>“wonderful”</strong>, and they’re going to make a difference.
          Even if not everyone shares the same level of optimism, there’s little
          denying their potential.
        </p>

        <h2>But What About AI’s Hallucinations And Our Reliance On Them?</h2>
        <p>
          Here’s the plot twist: as much as LLMs can help, they’re not
          infallible. In fact, LLMs are known to “hallucinate” that’s the
          technical term for when AI makes things up. Whenever AI tools are used
          to automatically write or modify code without a vigilant human in the
          loop, there’s the risk of introducing errors. The more we let go of
          oversight, the greater the odds of “hallucinations” slipping in and
          causing real world bugs.
        </p>

        <p>
          But as Jim notes, bugs are an everyday occurrence even{" "}
          <em>without</em> the help of advanced AIs. Software development has
          always been a dance with imperfection and, in his view, we might just
          be adding new missteps to an old routine.
        </p>

        <h2>The Verdict: AI in Programming Is Here But It’s Not Magic</h2>
        <p>
          As artificial intelligence embeds itself into development workflows,
          it brings new capabilities and new risks. LLMs won’t end human
          programming or the need for expertise and careful code review.
          Instead, they’ll serve as powerful, ever improving tools that help us
          catch dumb mistakes, speed up everyday development, and perhaps give
          us the optimism needed to keep building a better digital world.
        </p>

        <p>
          So whether you call LLMs “autocorrect on steroids,” the next frontier
          in automation, or simply another tool in the ever growing programmer’s
          toolkit, one thing is certain: they’re not going away and their impact
          will only grow.
