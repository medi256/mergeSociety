        </h2>

        <p>
          Welcome to 2025 the year artificial intelligence transforms from
          clever chatbot tricks to true digital agents that can act, reason,
          remember, and adapt. In this in depth article, we’ll unravel what “AI
          agents” really are, why they’re such a game changer for businesses and
          individuals alike, and how the landscape of generative AI is shifting
          from single minded models to systems that orchestrate entire
          workflows. If you’re curious about the next big leap in AI or want
          practical examples of how these systems work, you’re in the right
          place.
        </p>

        <h2>
          From Monolithic AI Models to Flexible Compound AI Systems: The
          Generative AI Shift
        </h2>
        <p>
          Let’s begin by examining a critical shift underway in generative AI.
          In the early days, we relied on monolithic models large language
          models trained on swathes of data, but, crucially, limited to whatever
          information they absorbed at training time. This means they lack real
          world context, live data, and often struggle to adapt on the fly. To
          change their knowledge or improve their answers, you’d need
          substantial resources to retrain or fine tune those models.
        </p>
        <p>
          To illustrate, imagine planning your summer vacation and wondering,{" "}
          <strong>“How many vacation days do I have left?”</strong> Feeding this
          query into a standard language model yields only an educated guess.
          The model knows nothing about you personally or Merge Society’s HR
          databases. You’d likely get an inaccurate answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, traditional models still shine at more generic tasks: summarizing
          documents, generating email drafts, and pulling together first draft
          reports. The real magic, however, happens when we start{" "}
          <em>building systems around models</em>, integrating them into our
          organizational processes and leveraging their power alongside external
          data and programmable logic.
        </p>

        <h2>The Magic of Compound AI Systems: Integration Is Everything</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine a smarter approach to the vacation example: now the AI system
          doesn’t just guess, but actively queries the company’s HR vacation
          database. The process looks like this:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The user’s question is sent to the language model.</li>
          <li>
            The model crafts a precise database search query (rather than simply
            responding with a guess).
          </li>
          <li>
            The system executes that query, fetches the correct vacation day
            number, and feeds it back to the model.
          </li>
          <li>
            The model then formulates a human readable answer:{" "}
            <em>“Maya, you have 10 vacation days left this year.”</em>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This modular approach combining models with external data,
          verification tools, and code is called a{" "}
          <strong>compound AI system</strong>. By breaking down tasks and
          choosing the right component for each, we get adaptable, powerful
          solutions that are far easier to configure than retraining giant
          models.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might have heard the term{" "}
          <strong>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> one of the most
          popular types of compound AI. In RAG, the system supplements the
          model’s knowledge by actively retrieving fresh content from databases
          or documents to answer queries more accurately.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Modular Systems Matter And Where They Fall Short</h2>
        <p>
          Compound systems excel at tasks that fit their carefully designed
          workflows. But they still have a critical limitation known as{" "}
          <strong>control logic</strong> the “path” a program follows to find an
          answer. For example, the vacation query system can only answer
          questions by checking the vacation policy database. If you suddenly
          ask about the weather in Florida, the system will fail. Why? Because
          its logic is programmed to always search the vacation database, and
          nowhere else it simply can’t adapt outside of its narrow path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, <strong>control logic</strong> acts as the brain of the system,
          explicit and static it decides which component runs and when, as
          prescribed by the human programmer. That’s effective for predictable,
          well defined tasks; but what if you want something more… autonomous?
        </p>

        <h2>Enter the AI Agent: Putting Large Language Models in Charge</h2>
        <p>
          The innovation that defines 2025? Giving the large language model
          (LLM) greater autonomy, letting it decide <em>how</em> to solve the
          problem based on its own advanced reasoning. These AI agents can break
          down complex problems, formulate plans, and dynamically decide which
          tools, databases, and actions to use as they work toward a solution
          even for tasks they’ve never seen before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Picture a spectrum of system autonomy: on the left, strict programs
          act instantly and never think outside their script (“think fast,
          follow instructions, never improvise”). On the right, you have agentic
          systems designed to “think slow”, plan, experiment, iterate, and
          revise their approach until they succeed. Just like a human problem
          solver, AI agents may break complex tasks into steps, get stuck,
          readjust, and draw on outside resources as needed.
        </p>

        <h2>Anatomy of an AI Agent: Reasoning, Acting, and Remembering</h2>
        <p>
          So what makes up an AI agent, specifically one based on a state of the
          art LLM?
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Reasoning:</strong> The LLM sits at the core of the agent,
            prompted to formulate plans, break down multi step processes, and
            reason through each phase not just spit out the first answer that
            comes to mind.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Action (via Tools):</strong> Agents can invoke external
            programs (known as <strong>tools</strong>) to execute steps. These
            might include APIs to search the web, access company databases, run
            calculations, manipulate spreadsheets, or even call other models
            (for example, to translate text).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Memory:</strong> AI agents build up logs of their internal
            “thinking,” as well as the history of conversations they’ve had with
            users. This memory enables context aware decision making, more
            personalized responses, and the ability to learn over time from
            previous interactions.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          A combination of these capabilities reasoning, acting, and remembering
          brings us to a powerful paradigm: <strong>the React agent</strong>.
          (Not to be confused with the JavaScript framework; here, React means
          “Reason and Act.”)
        </p>

        <h2>
          The React Agent in Action: A Real World Vacation Planning Example
        </h2>
        <p>
          To see this all in action, let’s return to our enthusiastic vacation
          planner. Imagine you want AI to answer:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “How many two ounce sunscreen bottles should I bring to Florida next
            month, considering I plan to spend lots of time outdoors?”
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This problem is surprisingly complex. Here’s how a React agent
          approaches it, step by step:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Determine how many vacation days you’re taking</strong>{" "}
            (retrievable from memory, given you previously asked about vacation
            days).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Estimate how many hours you’ll spend in the sun</strong>{" "}
            (perhaps by checking Florida weather forecasts for next month and
            calculating average sunshine hours).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Find recommended sunscreen dosage per hour</strong>{" "}
            (accessing public health recommendations online).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Do the math:</strong> Combine all collected data to
            determine how many two ounce bottles you’ll need for your trip.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          What’s powerful here is the{" "}
          <strong>modularity and flexibility</strong> of the agentic system: it
          can dynamically decide which tools and data sources to use, iterate
          its plan based on what it finds, correct itself if it encounters
          errors, and explore multiple paths to get the best solution.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Choosing Between Programmatic and Agentic Systems: When to Use Each
        </h2>
        <p>
          With all this flexibility, should we make every AI system agentic? Not
          necessarily. There’s a trade off between adaptability and efficiency.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            For <strong>narrow, well defined problem sets</strong> (like only
            answering vacation policy questions), a programmatic compound system
            is more <strong>efficient</strong>. It follows the same path each
            time, ensuring predictable, fast answers the best fit where
            creativity and adaptability aren’t needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            For <strong>broad, open ended, or novel challenges</strong> (like
            solving diverse GitHub issues, handling both vacation queries and
            Florida weather questions, or troubleshooting multi part processes),
            agentic systems shine. They can adapt, explore new paths, and figure
            out solutions that weren’t explicitly programmed in.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As 2025 unfolds, we’re witnessing a rapid evolution: compound systems
          are growing ever more agentic. The future belongs to AI tools that can
          not only answer questions, but dynamically plan, reason, adapt, and
          learn. For now, most systems will still include a human in the loop to
          check outputs and guide accuracy but as the technology improves,
          agents themselves will only get smarter and more capable.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts: The Agentic Future Is Here</h2>
        <p>
          AI agents aren’t a science fiction fantasy they’re arriving now,
          powered by breakthroughs in large language models, modular system
          design, and flexible integration with tools and memory. The line
          between rigid programs and adaptable agents is shortening, and this
          means more personalized, context aware, and agile digital assistants
          in every field.
        </p>
