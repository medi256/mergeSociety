        </h2>

        <p>
          Remember back when the internet arrived and visionaries everywhere
          were convinced that the days of bricks-and-mortar stores were
          numbered? The buzz was that we’d all soon be shopping exclusively
          online, leaving behind malls and charming main street shops for
          nothing but digital carts and checkout buttons. But reality had other
          plans: it turns out people enjoy the experience of shopping in person.
          We love to browse, to pick things up, to try them on. The lure of
          tactile discovery, the thrill of the hunt—or, dare we say, our inner
          hunter-gatherer—can’t be out-coded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, brick-and-mortar shops haven’t had it easy. Financial
          pressures, changing consumer habits, and relentless competition from
          e-commerce giants mean keeping those doors open is no walk in the
          park. But the enduring fact remains: we like going shopping. There’s
          something fundamentally human in the act, and not all the algorithms
          in the world can replicate that feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here’s where many technologists miss the mark. And with all respect to
          the engineers out there, there’s an uncomfortable truth: technology
          doesn’t solve every human problem. Take friendship, for example.
          Technology might be able to spit out advice during tough times, but
          nothing beats sitting beside someone you care about, feeling the
          warmth of a hand on your shoulder, and hearing, “Don’t worry, I’ve got
          your back.” That moment of genuine, human reassurance? There’s no
          app—or AI—that can replace it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many predictions around artificial intelligence fall into the same
          category as those early internet prophecies: they’re grand promises,
          but most remain unfulfilled. Sure, what we’re seeing is fascinating.
          AI and algorithms are evolving—they’ve been around for ages and are
          only getting more sophisticated. Some of the progress is genuinely
          incredible. Yet, a large portion of what’s promised is still on the
          horizon. So, for now, I prefer to take a “wait and see”
          approach—without cynicism, but with a healthy dose of reality. In the
          meantime, my faith is very much in humanity.
        </p>
        <h2>The Human Impact of Technology—A Look Back</h2>
        <p>
          To understand where we might be headed with AI, it’s worth looking in
          the rearview mirror. Remember the 1970s and 1980s? Robotics began
          popping up on factory floors everywhere, transforming industries—and
          not always gently. Back then, robots took over roles once held by
          countless blue-collar workers. Today’s car factories are filled with
          mechanized arms that weld, paint, and assemble with inhuman precision,
          reducing the number of jobs for people. Where there were once teams of
          skilled human hands, now, it’s largely machines with a few supervisors
          monitoring them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The response from the “white collar” class and Wall Street types was
          predictable: “Just re-skill.” Suddenly, former assembly line workers
          were expected to become software engineers or data analysts. But as we
          stare down the rise of AI, don’t expect a repeat for blue-collar
          roles. AI won’t be driving your taxi, hauling your luggage at the
          airport, fixing your plumbing, or building your house—at least not
          anytime soon. Those jobs demand real-world dexterity and human
          judgment that, for now, machines can’t match.
        </p>
        <h2>Where AI Will Strike: The Knowledge Economy</h2>
        <p>
          What’s at stake as AI advances? If you’re in the knowledge economy—the
          realm of writers, analysts, accountants, and consultants—it’s time to
          pay close attention. AI will absolutely transform knowledge work. Do I
          think it’ll utterly wipe these roles out? Absolutely not. Will it
          demand new skills and create jobs we haven’t even dreamed of? Without
          a doubt. But there’s no question that the fabric of the modern
          office—the knowledge worker’s kingdom—is shifting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine the newsroom of the future. Currently, the writer is crowned
          king, while editors play second fiddle. But soon, that could flip. AI
          can crank out a serviceable first draft of a press release, but it’s
          the sharp-eyed editor—the person who can tell a story, spot mistakes,
          and bring a unique human sensibility—who will be invaluable. In fact,
          editors are poised to become the heroes of the creative process.
        </p>
        <h2>AI: A Tool, Not a Threat—If You Look Forward</h2>
        <p>
          There’s no need to fear AI. Could AI write a book mimicking Simon
          Sinek’s style? Sure—by remixing everything he’s already written. But
          could AI dream up something new, like a book about the deeper meaning
          of friendship, before a human decides to pursue it? Not a chance. AI
          is grounded in the past—it learns by looking backward, analyzing
          what’s come before. But people? We look forward. We search for
          purpose, for meaning, for what’s next. That’s something AI can’t do on
          its own.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the best way to thrive in the age of AI isn’t to dwell on what’s
          being replaced or automated, but to double down on those things that
          make us most human: our vision, our purpose, and our ability to
          imagine brighter futures. Use AI as a tool to help get you there, but
          don’t mistake the tool for the journey. As long as you’re looking
          forward, AI isn’t a threat—it’s your sidekick.
