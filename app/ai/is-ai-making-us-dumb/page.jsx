          <strong>“Thank. Thank you. Thank you.”</strong> — What once might have
          sufficed as a hasty email reply is now an entry point to a profound
          question in today’s tech-driven world. Imagine, instead, taking the
          time to type,{" "}
          <em>
            “Dear John, I wanted to say thank you for taking the time to meet
            for lunch last week. Please feel free to use this as a reference in
            the future. All the best.”
          </em>
          Even these small acts are shifting as artificial intelligence (AI)
          takes root in every facet of daily life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Welcome to another episode of <strong>ColdFusion</strong>, where we
          examine a future — the year is 2035 — where every office is powered by
          AI. That’s right: every email, presentation, and even playlist is
          generated by algorithms. Gone are the days when students needed to
          study the fundamentals; now, school is about mastering domain-specific
          AI tools and learning to prompt effectively. In this near-future
          vision, knowledge, answers, and even entertainment are just a prompt
          away.
        </p>

        <h2>Is This Progress — or Peril?</h2>

        <p>
          In decades past, such a scenario might have sounded like an episode
          straight out of <i>The Jetsons</i>, but as of 2025, it isn’t
          far-fetched. AI is part and parcel of just about every device we use
          today. So, the pressing question emerges:{" "}
          <em>
            Are we slowly offloading our cognitive responsibilities? Is AI
            silently making us dumber?
          </em>
        </p>

        <p>
          To clarify, AI is already driving revolutions in science, physics, and
          medicine – the story today is about "consumer AI," or as some have
          labeled it, "AI slop": the run-of-the-mill models populating our daily
          tools and feeds. The <strong>real issue is overuse</strong>. Don't
          worry—the story isn't all doom and gloom. We'll close with practical
          ways to avoid falling into the mental quicksand of over-automated
          life.
        </p>

        <h2>How Technology Changes Our Brain: The Google Maps Effect</h2>

        <p>
          Consider how technology has already re-wired our minds. Take{" "}
          <b>Google Maps</b>, for example. A 2020 study revealed that, although
          GPS apps provide great economic benefits, heavy users showed weakened
          spatial memory. Ironically, these individuals didn’t even realize
          their sense of direction had deteriorated, even when the data made it
          clear.{" "}
          <strong>Convenience, it turns out, often comes at a price.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          And keep in mind: GPS isn't even AI; it's just an app. If mere map
          apps can diminish our memory, what might today's interactive AI
          systems be doing to our ability to think?
        </p>

        <h2>AI in Academia: When Tools Replace Skills</h2>

        <p>
          Around the same time as the GPS study, <strong>David Raffo</strong>, a
          professor and academic observer, noticed a sudden, dramatic
          improvement in his students’ written work during the lockdown. The
          leap in quality was so striking, it seemed unnatural. When he
          confronted his class, the truth surfaced: students were turning to AI
          writing tools.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          “I realized it was the tools that improved their writing—not their
          writing skills.” —David Raffo
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Raffo didn't shame his students. Instead, he called it a mixed bag: AI
          can help us work more efficiently and gather information, but, "Our
          mental and cognitive abilities are like muscles… they need regular
          exercise to remain strong and vibrant. It takes an extraordinary
          person to resist the temptation of easier answers."
        </p>

        <h2>The Risk of Mental Atrophy</h2>

        <p>
          This is echoed by <strong>Dr. Ann McKee</strong>, Alzheimer’s
          researcher, on <em>The Diary of a CEO</em> podcast. She revealed that
          half the population who reach 85 will show signs of Alzheimer’s
          pathology in their brain. The mitigation?{" "}
          <b>Stay mentally active. Challenge your mind.</b> That "cognitive
          reserve" can help circumvent symptoms{" "}
          <i>even when disease is present</i>.
        </p>

        <h2>Cognitive Offloading: The Downside of Delegation</h2>

        <p>
          To illustrate the pitfalls of AI-driven convenience, consider a
          simple, real-world example. During the episode, the host glances back
          at a bookshelf, then asks Gemini, Google’s AI, “Did you catch the
          title of the white book behind me?” Gemini nails it:{" "}
          <em>Atomic Habits by James Clear</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This fun exchange underscores a deeper risk — one that’s easy to miss
          as tech seeps into our routines. The more we outsource recall and
          understanding to AI, the less we’re compelled to use our own
          brainpower.
        </p>

        <p>
          Studies have measured the broader effects, too. Research on
          calculators and autocorrect has already shown negative side effects:
          as students rely on spell check, their spelling and punctuation skills
          atrophy. Next comes the AI writing assistant, which doesn’t just{" "}
          <i>suggest</i> — it <i>thinks</i> for you.
        </p>

        <h2>Cognitive Offloading Goes Mainstream</h2>

        <p>
          As AI rolls into everything from data entry to customer service, so
          too does “<strong>cognitive offloading</strong>”—the process of
          outsourcing mental labor to technology. Over 600 people, from
          different walks of life, were surveyed to see how AI impacts critical
          thinking. The results weren’t reassuring: heavy users grew dependent,
          relinquishing problem-solving and decision-making to AI rather than
          engaging their own minds.{" "}
          <strong>
            The result: weaker critical evaluation and diminished nuance in
            conclusions.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <h2>When AI Replaces Judgement — Even in the Justice System</h2>
        <p>
          This isn’t just an academic worry. In 2023, Detroit police arrested
          Portia Woodruff, 8 months pregnant, after their AI-driven facial
          recognition flagged her as the culprit in a robbery. The AI based its
          claim on a years-old mugshot from an expired license infraction;
          Woodruff could not have committed a violent crime at that time. She
          suffered not just through wrongful arrest, but dehydration and labor
          complications. Ultimately, the charges were dropped, but not before
          tremendous personal cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Detroit’s police face multiple lawsuits for similar arrests — all due
          to overreliance on DataWorks Plus, their AI vendor. The technology,
          marketed as a revolutionary aid, became a shortcut to erroneous
          thinking. This is the dark side of convenience: errors slip by
          unnoticed, especially when automation is trusted by default.
        </p>

        <h2>“Algorithmic Complacency”: Letting the Internet Decide for Us</h2>

        <p>
          The pattern plays out every day, on social media and beyond. On
          platforms like X (formerly Twitter), people routinely ask Grok AI to
          explain even the simplest posts. Instead of thinking, users outsource
          basic comprehension.
        </p>
        <p>
          This extends to how we consume content. As{" "}
          <strong>Alec Watson</strong> (Technology Connections) states,
          “Algorithmic Complacency” is when users let recommendation engines
          choose what they see, read, or watch — even when alternatives are
          available. Just recall how, two decades back, users searched for and
          bookmarked favorite sites manually. Today, platforms curate nearly
          everything, and we’re largely unaware of how rarely we select for
          ourselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Working smarter or sabotaging ourselves?</strong> While
          delegating repetitive tasks to AI is efficient, using it to handle all
          thinking makes us dull. Younger generations, who grew up clicking
          “recommend” or “auto-complete,” are particularly vulnerable; recent
          graduates bring these habits to the workplace, often hiding their weak
          skills behind AI tools.
        </p>

        <h2>
          From the Information Age to the Knowledge Age — Risks and Realities
        </h2>

        <p>
          The internet once offered raw data, now synthesized into bite-sized,
          AI-crafted knowledge. In theory, this should empower users — if that
          “knowledge” is reliable. But early missteps abound: Google’s AI
          Overviews have delivered everything from factual errors (“Obama was
          America’s first Muslim commander in chief,” or “Snakes are mammals”)
          to unsafe advice (“Eat a rock daily for health!”).
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, usage rises: 70% of people trust AI news summaries, and 36%
          believe the models are consistently factually accurate. Yet, a BBC
          investigation revealed that more than half of AI-generated summaries
          were flawed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even simple editing tasks, like asking ChatGPT to “make this passage
          nicer,” can subtly alter the original meaning. Most don’t catch the
          mistake. The underlying issue is deeper still: as Oxford researchers
          showed, when AI repeatedly rewrites other AI-generated content,
          quality declines with each pass — a phenomenon they dubbed “model
          collapse.” After only two rounds, output quality drops; by the ninth,
          the text becomes nonsense. This degradation, while initially subtle,
          is insidious and particularly damages inputs representing minority
          viewpoints or lesser-known subjects.
        </p>

        <h2>The Self-Devouring Internet and the “Dead Internet” Theory</h2>

        <p>
          According to Amazon Web Services, an estimated 60% of all internet
          content in 2024 has been generated or translated by AI. This echo
          chamber effect means the internet is slowly “eating itself,” each
          AI-generated output becoming training fodder for ever more garbled
          content. This is central to the so-called “Dead Internet Theory,”
          which posits that most online content is now created by bots rather
          than humans.
        </p>

        <p>
          We face two possible futures: either AI evolves rapidly enough to
          stabilize and improve knowledge, or we descend further into a swirling
          pool of “AI slop”—inaccurate, incomprehensible data.
        </p>

        <h2>Don’t Panic—Understand the Limitations</h2>

        <p>So, should we swear off AI? Not quite.</p>

        <p>
          As <strong>Geoffrey Hinton</strong>, the so-called godfather of AI,
          cautions: “ChatGPT is an idiot savant. It doesn’t know the difference
          between truth and lies, because it is trained on inconsistent data and
          tries to predict what someone might say next.” Unlike humans, language
          models blend myriad opinions with no coherent worldview.
        </p>

        <p>
          For generations raised in this always-on, always-assisted era,
          unquestioning trust in AI is dangerously easy. But as history (and
          professors everywhere) show, surrendering foundational thinking skills
          leads to long-term consequences.
        </p>

        <h2>The Office of the Future: AI Everywhere</h2>

        <p>
          Today, surveys show that Gen Z and younger Millennials use two or more
          AI tools every week at work. Businesses find that, especially for
          repetitive tasks like finding the “right tone” for emails or recalling
          dense meeting details, AI boosts efficiency. But these same users risk
          never strengthening their own creative or reasoning muscles. The
          result? Overreliance, atrophy, and a growing blind spot to AI error.
        </p>

        <h2>Travel Tip: Avoiding Pitfalls with the Right Tech</h2>

        <p>
          Speaking of smart tech, a quick aside: if you’re traveling, don’t
          gamble with getting connected overseas. Services like{" "}
          <strong>Saily</strong> from Nord Security let you grab an affordable
          best-in-class eSIM for over 150 countries. Setup is effortless: just
          buy a plan in the app or on the website, activate, and you’re
          online—no swapping SIMs or hunting for WiFi. Personally, the author
          shares a story of a colleague who, unable to avoid excessive roaming
          charges in the U.S., relied on this tool—a real reminder that not all
          digital advances are negative, if used wisely. (And with the code{" "}
          <strong>ColdFusion</strong>, readers can snag 15% off.)
        </p>

        <h2>A Historical Perspective: Fear of Automation Isn’t New</h2>

        <p>
          The spreadsheet revolution of 1979, courtesy of Dan Bricklin and Bob
          Frankston’s <strong>VisiCalc</strong>, drew tears from accountants: no
          more manual recalculations over typo-induced errors! Far from ending
          the need for human accountants, VisiCalc let those who understood the
          basics become vastly more productive. AI can—if handled
          responsibly—play a similar role.
        </p>

        <h2>The Path Forward: AI As a Companion, Not a Replacement</h2>

        <p>
          So, what's the key? <b>Use AI as a companion</b>—a helpful tool that
          augments, not replaces, your thinking. Always take answers with a
          skeptical eye and a grain of salt. As Professor Thomas Dietrich
          clarifies: “Large language models are <i>statistical models</i>, not
          true knowledge bases. They answer at length, even if they have nothing
          useful to say, and rarely refuse a question.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Until models can self-assess their competence, users must provide the
          discernment. Neural networks are limited by what they’ve been exposed
          to—their “knowledge” mirrors the data, including its gaps and biases.
        </p>

        <h2>Lessons From the Past—Calculators and Critical Thinking</h2>

        <p>
          A 1988 newspaper image, shown during the episode, depicts elementary
          school teachers protesting the use of calculators in the classroom—not
          demanding a blanket ban, but arguing that basic skills should come
          first. The same should apply to AI.{" "}
          <b>
            It's a powerful tool, but we must ensure we understand the
            underlying concepts before outsourcing too much.
          </b>
        </p>

        <p>
          No matter how advanced AI gets, the human mind—its{" "}
          <strong>authentic experience</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>critical judgment</strong>—remains irreplaceable. Until the
          age of hypothetical AI overlords, our most valuable resource is our
          ability to think independently. As philosopher René Descartes famously
          put it: “<em>I think, therefore I am.</em>”
        </p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts: Guard Your Cognitive Freedom</h2>

        <p>
          The episode concludes with an invitation: “I’d be interested to hear
          what you have to think.” After a deep dive into the risks and
          realities of consumer AI, the message is clear: choose tech wisely,
          keep those mental muscles strong, and never let convenience dull your
          mind. If you enjoyed this deep-dive, be sure to subscribe to{" "}
