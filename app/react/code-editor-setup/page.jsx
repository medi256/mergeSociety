      <h1>Setting Up Your Code Editor (VS Code Recommended)</h1>

      <p>
        Now that you have Node.js and npm installed, the next tool you’ll need
        is a <strong>code editor </strong> . A code editor is where you’ll
        write, edit, and manage all your React code. It’s kind of like the
        notebook or workspace where you’ll be crafting your projects.
      </p>

      <h2>What is a Code Editor?</h2>
      <p>
        A <strong> code editor</strong> is a special program designed for
        writing and editing code. While you can technically use any text editor
        (like Notepad or TextEdit) to write code, a code editor comes with
        features that make coding a lot easier and more efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think of it like this: Imagine trying to build a house. You could use
        your bare hands to carry bricks and hammer nails, but it would be much
        easier if you had the right tools—like a hammer, a wheelbarrow, or a
        level. Similarly, a code editor is packed with tools that help you write
        clean, error-free code quickly. It makes your job much easier!
      </p>

      <h2>Why We Recommend VS Code (Visual Studio Code)</h2>
      <p>
        There are many code editors out there, but we highly recommend{" "}
        <strong>Visual Studio Code (VS Code) </strong> , especially if you’re a
        beginner. Here’s why:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Beginner-friendly:</strong> VS Code is simple to use and easy
          to set up, making it perfect for those just getting started.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Free:</strong> It’s completely free to download and use, with
          no hidden costs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Helpful features:</strong> It comes with great features like
          <strong> syntax highlighting</strong> (which makes your code colorful
          and easier to read) and <strong> auto-completion</strong> (which helps
          you type faster by suggesting code as you write).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Extensions:</strong> You can add extra tools called
          "extensions" to make VS Code even more powerful. For example, there’s
          an extension for React that helps you write React code more
          efficiently.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cross-platform:</strong> Whether you’re using Windows, macOS,
          or Linux, VS Code works on all of them.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Step-by-Step Guide: Installing and Setting Up VS Code</h2>

      <h3>Step 1: Download VS Code</h3>
      <p>
        The first step is to download VS Code to your computer. Follow these
        steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Open your web browser and go to the official VS Code website:{" "}
          <a
            href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            https://code.visualstudio.com/
          </a>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          On the website, you’ll see a big blue button that says **Download for
          Windows** (or macOS/Linux, depending on your system). Click the button
          to start downloading the installer.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 2: Install VS Code</h3>
      <p>
        Once the download is complete, open the file to start the installation
        process. A setup wizard will appear, guiding you through the
        installation. Here’s what to do:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click "Next" on the welcome screen.</li>
        <li>Agree to the license terms and click "Next".</li>
        <li>
          Choose a destination folder for the installation (you can leave the
          default location unchanged).
        </li>
        <li>
          Select any additional tasks like creating a desktop shortcut (this
          makes it easy to open VS Code later).
        </li>
        <li>Click "Install" to begin the installation.</li>
        <li>
          Once the installation is complete, click "Finish" to launch VS Code.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Step 3: Explore the VS Code Interface</h3>
      <p>
        When you first open VS Code, you might feel a bit overwhelmed by all the
        buttons and options. But don’t worry! Let’s break down the key areas
        you’ll be using as a beginner:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Explorer:</strong> This is where you’ll see all the files and
          folders in your project. It’s like the file manager on your computer,
          but it’s built into VS Code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Editor:</strong> This is the main area where you’ll write your
          code. Each file you open will appear as a tab in this space, so you
          can easily switch between files.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Terminal:</strong> VS Code has a built-in terminal, which
          allows you to run commands directly within the editor. For example,
          you’ll use this terminal to run your React app later.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Extensions:</strong> On the left-hand side, you’ll see an icon
          that looks like four squares. This is where you can browse and install
          extensions to add more functionality to VS Code.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Step 4: Install Extensions (Optional)</h3>
      <p>
        VS Code is great on its own, but you can make it even better by adding
        **extensions**. Think of extensions as extra tools or features that can
        help you code more efficiently. For React, we recommend installing the
        following extensions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong> ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets</strong> : This
          extension provides shortcuts that will help you write React code
          faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong> Prettier - Code formatter </strong>: This is a tool that
          automatically formats your code, making sure it looks neat and
          organized.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To install an extension, click the <strong>Extensions </strong> icon
        (the four squares) on the left side of the screen. In the search bar,
        type the name of the extension you want to install, then click the
        <strong>Install </strong> button.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
      <p>
        Now that you have VS Code set up, you’re ready to start coding! In the
        next section, we’ll show you how to create your first React project
        using <strong> Create React App</strong>. This is where the fun really
        begins, so stay tuned!
      </p>
