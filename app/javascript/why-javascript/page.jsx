        <h1>Why Learn JavaScript?</h1>
        <p>
          JavaScript is an incredibly useful and versatile programming language
          that powers many interactive and dynamic websites you visit every day.
          Here are some reasons why learning JavaScript is a great idea:
        </p>

        <h2>Interactivity and User Experience</h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript makes web pages more interactive and engaging. It allows
          you to create a smooth and dynamic user experience.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Dynamic Content:</strong> JavaScript lets you change what
            users see on a webpage without reloading the entire page. This means
            you can create interactive forms, make things move, and update
            information instantly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User Engagement:</strong> JavaScript helps you respond to
            what users do on your website. For example, when they click a
            button, you can show a message or play a sound, making your website
            more fun to use.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Event Handling:</strong> JavaScript can detect things like
            clicks, typing, or moving the mouse. This lets you create
            interactive elements that respond to user actions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> With JavaScript, you can fetch
            new information from a server and update your webpage instantly, so
            users always see the latest data.
          </li>
        </ul>
