        <h2>4. Assignment Operators: Simplifying Your Code</h2>
        <p>
          Now that we’ve covered arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators,
          it’s time to look at assignment operators. These operators not only
          assign values to variables, but they also help us update those values
          more efficiently. If you’ve ever added points to a score, counted down
          to an event, or updated the progress of a task, you’ve likely used
          assignment operators without even realizing it!
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s explore how assignment operators can help make your code cleaner
          and faster.
        </p>

        <h3>The Basic Assignment Operator (=)</h3>
        <p>
          The simplest assignment operator is the equal sign (<code>=</code>).
          It assigns a value to a variable. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
              {`
let score = 10;
console.log("Initial score:", score); // Output: Initial score: 10
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This tells JavaScript to create a variable called <code>score</code>{" "}
          and give it the value of 10. Easy enough, right? But what if we want
          to increase the score as the game progresses?
        </p>

        <h3>The Addition Assignment Operator (+=)</h3>
        <p>
          Instead of writing something like <code>score = score + 5</code> every
          time we want to increase the score, we can use the addition assignment
          operator (<code>+=</code>):
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
              {`
let score = 10;
score += 5; // This is the same as score = score + 5
console.log("New score:", score); // Output: New score: 15
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          This operator adds the value on the right to the variable on the left
          and updates the variable. It’s a great shortcut for making your code
          cleaner.
        </p>

        <h3>Other Assignment Operators</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript has several other assignment operators that work in a
          similar way, helping you to quickly update values. Let’s take a look
          at a few of the most common ones:
        </p>

        <h4>Subtraction Assignment (-=)</h4>
        <p>
          Just like the addition assignment, the subtraction assignment operator
          reduces the value of a variable:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
              {`
let health = 100;
health -= 20; // This is the same as health = health - 20
console.log("Remaining health:", health); // Output: Remaining health: 80
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h4>Multiplication Assignment (*=)</h4>
        <p>
          The multiplication assignment operator multiplies the variable by the
          value on the right:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
              {`
let score = 10;
score *= 2; // This is the same as score = score * 2
console.log("Doubled score:", score); // Output: Doubled score: 20
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h4>Division Assignment (/=)</h4>
        <p>
          The division assignment operator divides the variable by the value on
          the right:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
              {`
let apples = 10;
apples /= 2; // This is the same as apples = apples / 2
console.log("Remaining apples:", apples); // Output: Remaining apples: 5
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
        <AdUnit />
        <h4>Modulus Assignment (%=)</h4>
        <p>
          The modulus assignment operator gives the remainder when dividing the
          variable by the value on the right:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
              {`
let total = 10;
total %= 3; // This is the same as total = total % 3
console.log("Remainder:", total); // Output: Remainder: 1
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>

        <h3>Combining Assignment Operators</h3>
        <p>
          Just like other operators, assignment operators can be combined with
          other types of operators to create powerful expressions. For example:
        </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
              {`
let level = 1;
let experience = 500;
let bonusPoints = 50;

experience += bonusPoints * level; // Adds 50 * 1 to experience
console.log("New experience:", experience); // Output: New experience: 550
          `}
            </SyntaxHighlighter>
          </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
          In this example, the bonus points are multiplied by the level before
          being added to the experience. Assignment operators save you from
          having to write longer code and help make your logic more efficient.
        </p>

        <h3>What's Coming Next?</h3>

        <h2>Practice Time!</h2>
        <p>
          Now it’s your turn to practice with assignment operators! Try these
          challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Write a program that tracks a player's score and increases it each
            time they win a round.
          </li>
          <li>
            Create a countdown timer that reduces the remaining time by 1 second
            until it reaches 0.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make a program that simulates spending money on items, reducing the
            balance each time an item is purchased.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Practice makes perfect, so keep experimenting with these operators and
          see how they can make your code more efficient!
