      <h1>JavaScript Scope</h1>

      <h2>Introduction to Scope</h2>
      <p>
        In JavaScript, scope refers to the area of a program where a variable is
        accessible. Think of scope as the visibility of variables: where you can
        see and use them. It's like having different rooms in a house where
        certain items are stored. Depending on the room you’re in, you might
        have access to different items.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are three main types of scope in JavaScript:{" "}
        <strong>global scope</strong>, <strong>local scope</strong>, and{" "}
        <strong>block scope</strong>. Each type determines where variables can
        be accessed and modified in your code.
      </p>

      <h2>Global Scope</h2>
      <p>
        Global scope refers to variables that are accessible from anywhere in
        your code. These variables are defined outside of any function or block
        and are available throughout the entire program.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
let globalVariable = 'I am global!'; // This variable is in the global scope

function showGlobal() {
console.log(globalVariable); // Accessing the global variable
}

showGlobal(); // Output: I am global!
console.log(globalVariable); // Output: I am global!
`}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, <code>globalVariable</code> is defined outside of any
        function or block, so it can be accessed both inside the{" "}
        <code>showGlobal</code> function and outside it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Global Scope Caution:</strong> While global variables seem
        convenient for sharing data across your entire program, using them
        excessively can lead to problems. Imagine multiple parts of your code
        accidentally modifying the same global variable, causing unexpected
        behavior. It's generally recommended to use local or block scope
        variables whenever possible to keep your code modular and avoid
        unintended side effects.
      </p>

      <h2>Local Scope</h2>
      <p>
        Local scope refers to variables that are only accessible within a
        specific function. These variables are defined inside a function and are
        not visible outside of that function. This helps to keep your code
        organized and prevents variable names from clashing.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
function localScopeExample() {
let localVariable = 'I am local!'; // This variable is in the local scope of the function
console.log(localVariable); // Accessing the local variable inside the function
}

localScopeExample(); // Output: I am local!

console.log(localVariable); // Error: localVariable is not defined
`}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Here, <code>localVariable</code> is defined inside the{" "}
        <code>localScopeExample</code> function. It can be accessed within the
        function but not outside of it, which causes an error when we try to log
        it outside the function.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Block Scope</h2>
      <p>
        Block scope refers to variables that are accessible only within the
        block of code (i.e., inside curly braces <code>{`{}`}</code>) where they
        are defined. This type of scope was introduced with <code>let</code> and{" "}
        <code>const</code> in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015).
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
if (true) {
let blockVariable = 'I am in a block!'; // This variable is in block scope
console.log(blockVariable); // Accessible within the block
}

console.log(blockVariable); // Error: blockVariable is not defined
`}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        In this example, <code>blockVariable</code> is defined inside an{" "}
        <code>if</code> block. It is accessible only within that block and
        causes an error when accessed outside the block.
      </p>

      <h2>Comparing Scopes</h2>
      <p>Let’s summarize how each type of scope works:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Global Scope:</strong> Variables are accessible from anywhere
          in your code. Be cautious with global variables as they can be
          modified from anywhere, potentially causing unintended side effects.
          For example, if multiple functions accidentally change the same global
          variable, it might lead to unpredictable behavior in your application.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Local Scope:</strong> Variables are accessible only within the
          function where they are defined. This helps in keeping functions
          modular and prevents conflicts with other parts of the code. For
          example, a variable declared inside a function won't affect other
          functions or parts of the code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Block Scope:</strong> Variables are accessible only within the
          block (e.g., <code>if</code> statements, loops) where they are
          defined. This provides more granular control over variable visibility
          and helps avoid issues in complex code structures. For instance, a
          variable inside a loop or conditional statement won’t be accessible
          outside of that block.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Examples and Use Cases</h2>
      <p>Here are a few examples to illustrate the different scopes:</p>

      <h3>Global Scope Example</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
let appName = 'My App'; // Global scope variable

function displayAppName() {
console.log(appName); // Can access global variable
}

displayAppName(); // Output: My App
`}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>
      
      <h3>Local Scope Example</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
function calculateSum(a, b) {
let sum = a + b; // Local scope variable
return sum;
}

console.log(calculateSum(5, 3)); // Output: 8
console.log(sum); // Error: sum is not defined
`}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h3>Block Scope Example</h3>
      <pre>
        <code>
          <SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript" style={docco}>
            {`
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
let blockVariable = i; // Block scope variable
console.log(blockVariable); // Accessible within the block
}

console.log(blockVariable); // Error: blockVariable is not defined
`}
          </SyntaxHighlighter>
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        Understanding scope is crucial for writing effective and bug-free
        JavaScript code. By knowing when and where variables can be accessed,
        you can better organize your code, avoid errors, and manage your data
        more efficiently. Use global variables sparingly and prefer local or
        block scope variables to keep your code clean and manageable.
